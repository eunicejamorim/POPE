This repository contains the dataset collected within the scope of my master's thesis and the results of the classification process. 

It is organized in two main folders:
- The [dataset](./dataset) folder contains all the data related to the collection made, which was later used in the prompts made for the LLM models. It includes all the information without further transformations and the modified versions. 
  - The [categories](./dataset/raw_data/categories.csv) file contains a list of all the categories of websites used to collect data from and each corresponding URL to the category metadata and list of websites. 
- The [models](./models) folder contains all the data used and generated in the scope of running the LLM models themselves.
