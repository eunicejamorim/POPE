How Do We Calculate the Cryptocurrency Market Cap? We calculate the total cryptocurrency market capitalization as the sum of all cryptocurrencies listed on the site. Does CoinMarketCap.com List All Cryptocurrencies? Almost. We have a process that we use to verify assets. Once verified, we create a coin description page like this . The world of crypto now contains many coins and tokens that we feel unable to verify. In those situations, our Dexscan product lists them automatically by taking on-chain data for newly created smart contracts. We do not cover every chain, but at the time of writing we track the top 70 crypto chains, which means that we list more than 97% of all tokens. How Big Is the Global Coin Market? At the time of writing, we estimate that there are more than 2 million pairs being traded, made up of coins, tokens and projects in the global coin market. As mentioned above, we have a due diligence process that we apply to new coins before they are listed. This process controls how many of the cryptocurrencies from the global market are represented on our site. What Is an Altcoin? The very first cryptocurrency was Bitcoin . Since it is open source, it is possible for other people to use the majority of the code, make a few changes and then launch their own separate currency. Many people have done exactly this. Some of these coins are very similar to Bitcoin, with just one or two amended features (such as Litecoin ), while others are very different, with varying models of security, issuance and governance. However, they all share the same moniker ‚Äî every coin issued after Bitcoin is considered to be an altcoin. What Is a Smart Contract? The first chain to launch smart contracts was Ethereum . A smart contract enables multiple scripts to engage with each other using clearly defined rules, to execute on tasks which can become a coded form of a contract. They have revolutionized the digital asset space because they have enabled decentralized exchanges, decentralized finance, ICOs, IDOs and much more. A huge proportion of the value created and stored in cryptocurrency is enabled by smart contracts. What Is a Stablecoin? Price volatility has long been one of the features of the cryptocurrency market. When asset prices move quickly in either direction and the market itself is relatively thin, it can sometimes be difficult to conduct transactions as might be needed. To overcome this problem, a new type of cryptocurrency tied in value to existing currencies ‚Äî ranging from the U.S. dollar, other fiats or even other cryptocurrencies ‚Äî arose. These new cryptocurrency are known as stablecoins , and they can be used for a multitude of purposes due to their stability. What Is an NFT? NFTs are multi-use images that are stored on a blockchain. They can be used as art, a way to share QR codes, ticketing and many more things. The first breakout use was for art, with projects like CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club gaining large followings. We also list all of the top NFT collections available, including the related NFT coins and tokens.. We collect latest sale and transaction data, plus upcoming NFT collection launches onchain. NFTs are a new and innovative part of the crypto ecosystem that have the potential to change and update many business models for the Web 3 world. What Are In-game Tokens? Play-to-earn (P2E) games, also known as GameFi , has emerged as an extremely popular category in the crypto space. It combines non-fungible tokens (NFT), in-game crypto tokens, decentralized finance (DeFi) elements and sometimes even metaverse applications. Players have an opportunity to generate revenue by giving their time (and sometimes capital) and playing these games. One of the biggest winners is Axie Infinity ‚Äî a Pok√©mon-inspired game where players collect Axies (NFTs of digital pets), breed and battle them against other players to earn Smooth Love Potion (SLP) ‚Äî the in-game reward token. This game was extremely popular in developing countries like The Philippines, due to the level of income they could earn. Players in the Philippines can check the price of SLP to PHP today directly on CoinMarketCap. What Are ETFs? In January 2024 the SEC approved 11 exchange traded funds to invest in Bitcoin. There were already a number of Bitcoin ETFs available in other countries, but this change allowed them to be available to retail investors in the United States. This opens the way for a much wider range of investors to be able to add some exposure to cryptocurrency in their portfolios. Which Is the Best Cryptocurrency to Invest in? CoinMarketCap does not offer financial or investment advice about which cryptocurrency, token or asset does or does not make a good investment, nor do we offer advice about the timing of purchases or sales.
