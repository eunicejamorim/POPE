We process this information even if you are not a user of Facebook, Messenger or Instagram and/or don’t have an account with us (a “ Non-User ”). Meta Platforms Ireland Limited is the controller of this information if you're a Non-user living in the European region. If you’re a Non-user living in the United Kingdom (“UK”), Meta Platforms, Inc. is the controller of this information. References in this Notice to "we", "us" or "our", should be interpreted to mean the relevant Meta Platforms entity (i.e. Meta Platforms Ireland Limited or Meta Platforms, Inc., as applicable) identified above as the controller of your information. About Contact Uploading and how it works When a user uses Contact Uploading and grants us access to their device’s address book. We will access and upload the names, phone numbers and email addresses in their address book on a daily basis to our servers, including those of both users of Facebook, Messenger and/or Instagram and other contacts who are not users or don’t have an account (i.e., Non-Users). What information is collected about Non-Users? We collect the name, mobile phone number and/or email address of a user's contacts. How do we use a Non-User’s information? Contact Uploading is an optional feature where users can choose to upload their device's address book to Facebook, Messenger and/or Instagram. We process the names, phone numbers and/or e-mail addresses in the address book to see if any of the numbers or email addresses belong to users. If a user’s contact is also on Facebook, Messenger and/or Instagram, we can suggest this contact on Facebook as someone to send a friend request to in the Facebook user’s People You May Know or as a suggested account to follow on Instagram. A user’s contact who is on Facebook, Messenger and/or Instagram may also be recommended people and things that are relevant to them so we can offer them a better service. Users can also invite Non-Users to join as users of Facebook, Messenger and/or Instagram via text or email. Contact Uploading also allows us to suggest a Non-User who joins as a user of Facebook as a friend to add for the user through People You May Know or as a suggested account to follow on Instagram. Finally, we will also use the address books uploaded to investigate suspicious activity on the Meta Products and keep our platform safe and secure.  We also conduct business intelligence and analytics using the address books uploaded to accurately count people and users of the Meta Company Products . Meta shares information we collect, infrastructure, systems and technology with the other Meta Companies . We share Non-Users’ data with other Meta Companies to be able to provide Contact Uploading and for the purposes set out above. We retain Non-User’s personal information for as long as needed to provide the Contact Uploading feature to users and for the purposes described above. In certain cases, we need to keep your contact information for longer, including after you ask us to erase it. This includes for legal reasons such as to respond to a legal request or comply with applicable law, for regulatory or litigation matters, to prevent harm or for safety, security and integrity purposes. The length of time we need to keep it will depend on the specific reason. What is our lawful basis for processing? We rely on our legitimate interests and the legitimate interests of our users to process the names, phone numbers and/or email addresses of Non-Users for the purposes described above. More specifically, we rely on our interests in operating and providing features of the Facebook, Messenger and/or Instagram to our users, and keeping the Meta Products safe and secure, alongside the interests of our users in more efficiently connecting with their contacts who use Facebook, Messenger and/or Instagram. How Non-Users exercise their data subject rights Under applicable data protection law, Non-Users have the right to access, rectify, port, and erase their information, as well as the right to restrict and object to certain processing of their personal information (“ Data Subject Rights ”). This includes the right to object to our processing of their information where we are pursuing our legitimate interests or those of a third party. We will consider several factors when assessing an objection from a Non-User including: their reasonable expectations; the benefits and risks to them, us, other users, and third parties; and other available means to achieve the same purpose that may be less invasive and do not require disproportionate effort. The objection will be upheld, and we will cease processing their personal information, unless the processing is based on compelling legitimate grounds or is needed for legal reasons. We hope that we can satisfy any queries a Non-User may have about the way in which we process their personal information. However, if a Non-User has unresolved concerns they also have the right to complain to Meta Ireland Ltd.’s lead supervisory authority, the Irish Data Protection Commission, under the GDPR or any other compentent data protection supervisory authority. For Meta Platforms, Inc., the UK Information Commissioner’s Office is the competent  supervisory authority. Click here if you have a question about the rights you may have.
