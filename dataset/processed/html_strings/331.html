Premium Pro Starter “I’d recommend Linktree to other creators! It’s very powerful for getting more eyes on your content.” Catie T (Millennial Money Honey) , Designer, Art Director and Financial Independence Educator Got questions Why do I need a Linktree? Linktree is a single link that you can use to connect audiences to everything you are, everything you do and everything you care about. It enables you to share many links in one, so your followers, visitors and customers can find everything they’re looking for in one place. You can add it to your bio link on social media platforms like Tiktok and Instagram, include it in your email signatures, and even display it as a QR code to get your offline audiences connected with you online. Linktree is for everyone – that’s why 40M+ creators already swear by it! Can you get paid and sell things from a Linktree? Yes, you can! We offer plenty of ways to sell products and monetize your audience. You can collect tips, request payments for services, collect revenue from affiliate links, and sell your products right in your Linktree. A lot of Linktree creators see incredible results with online sales on Linktree, because it removes the extra steps involved in a purchase. With Paypal or Square right in your Linktree, your customers won’t even need to leave your social media to go to another site and pay! “We love how Linktree has helped us manage our business by having all social media and ways to pay in one location. The QR code has made it easy for customers to access it all!” – Tiffany Is Linktree safe to use on all of my social media profiles? Linktree is trusted by all social platforms, and is even used on many of Facebook, Instagram and TikTok’s own social media accounts! Because Linktree is the original and most popular link-in-bio tool, the linktr.ee URL is a trusted, identifiable and familiar link that audiences feel comfy and safe clicking on. How can I drive more traffic to and through my Linktree? Sharing your Linktree on every social platform you have makes it easy for your most important content to be seen and engaged with by all of your followers. You can even use QR codes to generate online traffic in offline places, and drive people to your links. Once visitors arrive on your Linktree, easy-to-understand analytics help you quickly and easily discover where they’re coming from, and what they’re clicking on. You can immediately see what’s working and what’s not and improve your Linktree on the fly with different link placement, prioritized links, subheadings, animation and more to make sure your traffic is landing exactly where you want it! Do I need a website to use Linktree? No, you don’t! Linktree can act as your very own mini-website to share, sell and grow without any of the time and effort it takes to build and maintain a regular website. You can create a design that fully reflects your personality and brand in seconds, with no knowledge, skills or experience needed. If you already have a website, that’s great: you can add it to your Linktree. “I hardly touch my website any more. I just send people to my Linktree! It’s a good-looking, fresh interface… so much more dynamic. I can take a few minutes, update my links and put my phone away rather than spending 45 struggling on WordPress.” – @ashleyhopeperez Where can I download the app?
