Reviews (117) 4.7 Stars Write a Review Classic silhouette adsherman - 21 May 2024 Went for these since the silhouette is very similar to my favorite NB, the 530s. There's quite a bit of cushion in the tongue and heel which makes for a snug fit. I'm always mens 7, women's 8.5 in nb and nike. I think a 9 would have been comfortable too but these will be fine. Just keep in mind if you're foots on the wider size and you're a halfer like me, you probably need to go up. Beautiful classic shoe though. ...
