Besides, the fabric is soft, light and drapes nicely. I'm 5'4, they just hit my foot without touching the floor. Size 25 and 26 both works for me, but I'm keep 26 for the volume. That reminds me of a styl... e from Chanel preSpring last year. I also saw the same style in khaki in store, really don't like the fabric, the cotton look thin and cheap. I suggest getting those directly from Doen. Read complete review Versus VS Most Liked Negative Review 1 Toxic Chemicals These pants REEK of toxic chemicals. After 4 washings, they still made everyone in my home sick. They all smell, online and in the few brick & mortar Gap stores left. It is not an odor, it is a chemical stench!
