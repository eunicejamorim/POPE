To serve every athlete individually and completely — across the hundreds of countries where we do business — we need teams that truly reflect the diversity of our consumers, and a culture of inclusivity. We aim to foster inclusion and embrace diversity throughout our business, teams and culture to bring us closer to the consumer, empower our employees to realize their full potential and create breakthrough innovations for athletes. Our diverse, high-performing teams around the world share a singular goal: to make all athletes better. At Nike, we embrace different perspectives because we know everyone brings unique experiences and ideas to the team. No matter where we come from, a love of sport unites us. It teaches us to be competitive and to value collaboration.","image":{"imageUrl":"/media/images/DEFE9700.original.original.jpg","alt":"","maxWidth":null,"maxHeight":null},"ctas":[{"text":"Learn more about Diversity at Nike","urlType":"external_url","openInNewTab":true,"queryParams":[],"anchorTag":"","relatedPage":"","externalUrl":"https://purpose.nike.com/","jobFilter":{},"id":"58eb17b21be941cd81373eb0ba6a1b2b"}]}],"seoDescription":"Discover the story behind the Swoosh and learn more about Nike, Inc. careers worldwide.","seoTitle":"Nike Careers Home","noRobots":false,"hasError":false}}},"siteSearch":{"status":"IDLE","open":false,"url":"","queryParams":{"keywords":"","limit":36,"offset":"0","sort_key":"last_published","sort_dir":"desc"},"results":{"links":{"first":"","last":"","next":"","prev":""},"pages":[],"meta":{"pagination":{"page":-1,"pages":-1,"count":-1}}}},"preview":{"redirectTo":""},"shared":{"html":""},"settings":{"api":{"en":{"components":[{"id":"be5a6147a8034d1f8470355f68dae11e","type":"FindYourFitShortcut","show":false,"title":"Find your fit","cta":{"text":"Start now"},"image":"/media/images/nike-job-fyf-ad.original.jpg"},{"id":"471dbc8c06db45c49eb232546dae4368","type":"HowWeHireShortcut","show":true,"title":"How We Hire","text":"At NIKE, Inc. we promise to provide a premium, inclusive, compelling and authentic candidate experience.
