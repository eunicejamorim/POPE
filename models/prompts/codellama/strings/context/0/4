I use this every single day! It fits perfectly in cupholder, It’s the 40 oz and it’s absolutely perfect! It’s big enough to hold a good amount of water But not too big to where I feel like it’s inconvenient to carry around. The straw is Bendy on the outside, but attached on the inside is a hard angled Straw. It never leaks. It’s a suction top So I’m really surprised! I have been using it Every day since I got it three months ago! It’s very durable and the material is great! I have left my cold water in my hot car in this cup for hours and came back and it was so cold! I just really love this water bottle and it’s got me to drink a lot more water! Highly recommend you buy this!

Keli Ann Beres 5.0 out of 5 stars Hydro Flask Tumbler: My Magical, Lead-Free Hydration Sidekick Reviewed in the United States on April 16, 2024 Style: 40 Oz Color: Baltic Verified Purchase Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, hydrators of all ages, gather around as I introduce you to the David Copperfield of travel tumblers—the Hydro Flask All Around. This isn't just any cup; it's a hydration hero in stainless steel armor. And guess what? It's not joining the lead parade like those other tumblers people are practically starting riots over. Nope, this Hydro Flask keeps it clean and pure, just like my conscience when I skip the gym. This cup is magic, folks. How magic, you ask? Well, it keeps my coffee hot enough to wake the dead and my iced tea chilly enough to cool down summer sidewalk sizzles—all day long. And it doesn’t sweat! That’s right, no more embarrassing cup rings on your important papers or your boss's fancy table. But the real trick up its sleeve? It helps me stay hydrated like a boss. Water has never tasted so crisp, and if you listen closely, you can almost hear it thanking you for not dipping it in lead. Ah, refreshment without the heavy metal—just what the doctor ordered! And let’s not forget about its sleek design. While everyone else is out there playing bumper carts for a Stanley, my Hydro Flask sits quietly on my desk, exuding an aura of calm superiority. It whispers, “I don’t need to be in a stampede, I’m already the best.” So, if you want to join the elite club of smart hydration, get yourself the Hydro Flask All Around Travel Tumbler. It's the lead-free, sweat-free, hassle-free superstar of staying quenched. And let's be honest, who doesn't want a little magic in their daily grind?

Reviewed in the United States on May 24, 2024 Style: 32 Oz Color: Cactus Verified Purchase I love the flexible straw, cup holder adapted bottom, 32oz size to encourage me to drink more water, and keeps the temperature the same all day long. And the color is cute too 😊 Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback... Thank you for your feedback. Sorry, we failed to record your vote. Please try again Report A. Ryan 5.0 out of 5 stars Very well-made and attractive tumbler Reviewed in the United States on April 13, 2024 Style: 40 Oz Color: Lupine Verified Purchase This isn't exactly leakproof, only because if it fell on its side -- liquid would slowly drip out of the straw hole. There's not much you can do about that, as it's a necessary feature to have a tiny air hole to displace air from the liquid as it's removed through the straw. Simple physics. Otherwise, this tumbler is nearly everything I could ask for; sturdy, virtually seamlessly designed, and works like a charm to keep the contents inside perfectly insulated for an extended time. Plus, I love the lavender color, and people have complimented it a few times. The only feature I regret is that this tumbler did not come with an appropriate way to sip hot liquids, as the straw is supposedly "not suitable" for that purpose. Sure, you could take off the lid entirely and drink from it as if from a regular cup, but that does compromise its heat insuation properties. And it would also be much less spillproof. Oh well, you can't have everything. Read more 11 people found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback... Thank you for your feedback. Sorry, we failed to record your vote.

Some years ago before all the tumbler hype, we purchased our first Hydro Flask while visiting Universal Studios City Walk.  Loved it back then but became so distracted with all the must have tumbler hype, and our Hydro Flask lived in our cabinet for years, unused. Recently we have all become alarmed with the announced lead concerns associated with stainless tumblers.  We researched stainless tumblers that are lead free and Hydro Flask continued to surface in our results.  We pulled our Hydro Flasks out of the cabinet and started using them again but the ones we have didn't fit in our car cup holders, so searched the brand and were so excited to find this one. I LOVE THIS TUMBLER! I was worried about the lid because I'm not a fan of plastic straws.  In the past, I've purchased glass straws but after living with this a bit, I've fallen in love! The tumbler straw is in two parts.  The upper is silicone which is very easy to maintain clean.  It pops out of the lid so you can clean it easily.  Having a flexible upper straw is so convenient because there are times when you need to pull the straw close to you.  The lower straw is plastic and slides into the silicone one.  I did purchase replacement straws for the lower part of the tumbler so I can swap them as needed. Now, let's talk about leaking.  I have knocked it over multiple times on the sofa.  If my straw cap is on, it doesn't leak (purchased separately which fits easily).  If the straw cap is off, the most that will happen is you'll see a drop or two.  There's a tiny vent hole in the lid that controls leaks too.  Overall, this tumbler is leak proof! Last...performance.  If I fill this tumbler 1/2 with ice and the rest with water, the ice will remain through the day, even as I continue to add water.  I've traveled with it, and left it in the hot car and again never any concerns about my water not remaining cold. Bravo...lead free, leak free, keeps water ice cold, easy to clean, and fits in your cup holder.  Perfect!

I went through a stanely phase and at first it was great, cute colors, sturdy, trendy, but oh my goodness how easy it was to knock over and spill everything, absolute madness. The hydroflask is everything that the stanely isnt. Leak proof, easy to clean and to screw the top on. Quality is lovely and keeps my water cool like i could leave water in there for 2 days and it would still be cold. Love it :) Read more 10 people found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback...

Reviewed in the United States on April 19, 2024 Style: 32 Oz Color: Agave Verified Purchase I love this cup! I use it every day for my water. The hydroflask keeps my drink cold all day. I haven’t washed it in dishwasher yet, but don’t really need to. The cup comes clean very easily with hand washing. The lid fits snug, but is easy to put on and take off. There’s been several times when my cup has been bumped and there are no spills. I am very happy with the cup so far and I’m thinking about ordering a 2nd one.

This is yet another great type of cup from them. It fits in the standard cupholder, which is great. The handle is comfortable. The color is great. I have not had any issues with leaking. It has been easy to clean. I now have two of these so that I can keep one at work and the other at home for travel purposes. I will say, I did not expect to be a fan of the flexible straw, but I actually enjoy it. Read more One person found this helpful Helpful Sending feedback... Thank you for your feedback.

It’s nice that it has a flexible silicone straw on the outside part of the lid and a solid clear plastic straw on the interior of the cup.
