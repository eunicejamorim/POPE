Jake Paul should feel like an idiot, but he’s immune to shame.

Mike is a beast, he took down monsters in the ring, not say your Grandma isn’t mean, but we are talking one of the goat boxers of all times. Big difference. Reply reply GloriaToo • 16h ago I'd dig all of mine up and do the same. Reply reply 23 more replies 23 more replies More replies DasFunke • 16h ago Jake Paul set up an exhibition match that will sell out a stadium and be broadcast live on Netflix. Why would he feel like an idiot? Reply reply 7 more replies 7 more replies More replies alwayzdizzy • 16h ago Just from the language he uses to hype up the fight, he's convinced himself almost-60-Tyson is peak Tyson just the same. Reply reply Stlr_Mn • 16h ago Jake Paul is going to lose to an ailing man more than twice his age I guess. 57 is geriatric lol Reply reply trebek321 • 10h ago There’s 0 chance the fight isn’t fixed regardless.

But they won’t do that Reply reply nonstickpotts • 16h ago This is all for show anyways. This shit is as real as WWE Reply reply _coolranch • 14h ago The x factor is… does Mike Tyson know how to act? You can’t make a tiger a house cat. They don’t like dat. Reply reply littlemachina • 14h ago Imo if it’s rigged it would be in Mike’s favor. Absolutely nobody wants to see him lose even if it’s the realistic outcome Reply reply 1 more reply 1 more reply More replies IDphantom • 13h ago Ironically, in the one movie I have seen him in (The Hangover) he quite literally had a tiger as a house cat.

Reply reply 2 more replies 2 more replies More replies BeefInGR • 11h ago At least his brother is believable in WWE. Actually, as much as I hate him, Logan is damn good for as fresh as he is. Reply reply puckit • 23m ago He's a legit prodigy. It's unreal how good he is for how little experience he has. Reply reply 1 more reply 1 more reply More replies 1 more reply 1 more reply More replies JackiesFetus • 14h ago Didn't he lose to the only professional boxer he ever fought? And if i recall correctly that dude isn't even a good professional boxer. Reply reply starker • 11h ago He’s Tommy Fury, 10-0. But his last two matches have been “influencer” matches vs KSI and Paul. I don’t know if he’s taking cheesecake matches or what, I don’t really follow the sport. Reply reply Several_Quiet7662 • 8h ago Calling Tommy Fury a pro boxer is an insult to boxing. His first 6 opponents had a combined record of 14-178-3. Three of them had never even won as a pro. Reply reply Theratchetnclank • 4h ago Exactly the guy was on love island. That's all you need to know about how serious of a boxer he is. Reply reply Snarsnel • 2h ago I wanna see Tyson on love island Reply reply trixtah • 1h ago “I’ll fuck you till you love me” Reply reply More replies More replies More replies More replies More replies Nkognito • 17h ago I think Jake should fight Taylor Swift, I mean he must really want to prove himself as someone who didn't get rich by being annoyingly popular. Reply reply gamers542 • 16h ago Whoa. What did Taylor do to you? Reply reply potpro • 15h ago Are you ASSuming TSwift wouldn't beat the shit out Jake? Reply reply 5 more replies 5 more replies More replies redshopekevin • 16h ago Nah. He doesn't want to lose to a girl. Reply reply More replies moviemerc • 12h ago Insert Pawn Stars meme "best I can do is Chael Sonnen" Reply reply Birdhawk • 16h ago And fight someone who isn’t willing to take extra cash under the table to go easy on him and just have a hugging match every round until it’s over.

Mike is too old for that shit Reply reply Lux-uk • 16h ago I mean, he will be even older now when it takes place.

Reply reply 1 more reply 1 more reply More replies More replies WORLD_IN_CHAOS • 11h ago Whenever the fight happens, iron Mike will be the oldest he’s ever been and the youngest he’ll ever be. Same with Paul Reply reply 1 more reply 1 more reply More replies super_sayanything • 16h ago Chicago Bears My first thought too. Just cancel this shit or make it a fun exhibition where they're hitting light and joking around.

(Back when this guy was eating ears.) Reply reply Real_Al_Borland • 15h ago Fake news! He spits bro. Reply reply More replies mrubuto22 • 16h ago Boxing has always had a freak show element Reply reply _coolranch • 14h ago Idk, man. There was at least integrity. This is a POS YouTube celeb cosplaying as a boxer. Reply reply mrubuto22 • 14h ago I'm not talking about actual sanctioned events but Muhammad Ali did a lot of this show bouts against pro wrestlers.  It's been around for awhile. Boxing has always been shady and all about the money. But I see your point as this appears to be the most boxing can offer these days. Reply reply jmerica • 13h ago Regarding your last sentence, there was an amazing fight between two of the best living boxers like two weeks ago… Reply reply 1 more reply 1 more reply More replies 1 more reply 1 more reply More replies terrybrugehiplo • 14h ago I miss the days of boxing integrity when butterbean was smashing people, and when Rocky fought hulk hogan. Those were the days Reply reply Amber4481 • 14h ago No you’re right. And I think it comes down to HBO dropping boxing and then Showtime following. There’s no place for people to see the younger generation of fighters without them getting lucky enough to land a decent undercard spot on a PPV. Not having Friday night fights really takes out the organic way boxers had to build a fan base so now the sport is pandering to influencers to get people to buy the PPVs. Reply reply More replies 1 more reply 1 more reply More replies mattyhtown • 16h ago I’d agree with you if we didn’t just get Usyk and Fury. I’d generally agree with you Reply reply 3 more replies 3 more replies More replies droppinkn0wledge • 12h ago Usyk and Fury just had a fantastic bout that saw Usyk unify the heavyweight belts for the first time in decades. The Fury/Wilder trilogy was one for the ages. Every Canelo showing is fantastic. Boxing is alive and well for anyone who isn’t an absolute casual. Reply reply super_sayanything • 16h ago Chicago Bears It's not real, it's just what gets clicks and our attention. Reply reply 5 more replies 5 more replies More replies Modz_B_Trippin • 16h ago This fight is kind of a joke to begin with. Every fight with Jake Paul in it is a joke. Reply reply Ammo89 • 14h ago It’s his boxing version of WWE. Reply reply cutthechatter_red2 • 14h ago Eventually he’s gunna get his ass whooped and it’s going to be the best TV in 20 years. Reply reply 1 more reply 1 more reply More replies More replies levitikush • 16h ago I love how Reddit went from “Mike is gonna murder that guy!” To “Jake Paul is such a dick I can’t believe he wants to fight this helpless old man” Reply reply LostHero50 • 16h ago No other sport has as many armchair experts as combat sports does. Reply reply MoeKara • 15h ago No other (insert anything ever) has as many armchair experts as Reddit does.

There’s a reason he keeps fighting aging and washed up fighters Reply reply Dynastydood • 16h ago There's no money in fighting people his own age. Reply reply lkodl • 14h ago • Edited 14h ago Nah, if Jake Paul was just getting his ass beat every fight, there's be like 10Xmany viewers, easy. So many people would pay to watch him get his ass beat. He'd probably make new fans who would encourage his shitty behavior, just so that it's more satisfying to  watch him get beat later. He could be the Michael Jordan of getting his ass beat. He just doesn't have the balls... Reply reply More replies themightycfresh • 13h ago While I don’t entirely disagree, he did fight Tommy Fury and at least take him to a decision and a close fight Reply reply NomadicFragments • 56m ago "close fight" Reply reply More replies 1 more reply 1 more reply More replies QuoteOpposite6511 • 14h ago Postponed and hopefully soon cancelled. This fight should never take place. We do not need to see it. Reply reply HalobenderFWT • 15h ago Yeah, well… it’s still real to me! Sob Reply reply filthychuck • 12h ago This whole thing is dumb Reply reply RunningForIt • 14h ago Fuck it, tap me in Mike. I’ve got 0 boxing experience but I’ll do my best. Reply reply super-mega-bro-bro • 17h ago It’s almost like fighting someone close to retirement age to prove your masculinity is …risky 😅 Reply reply brett1081 • 16h ago He’s not proving anything he’s getting paid just like Tyson. Reply reply 4 more replies 4 more replies More replies SpaceStar_Ordering_ • 15h ago When asked to comment Tyson shouted, “Iss SPINAL!” Reply reply Fresh_Salamander_393 • 3h ago Fight? It’s not a fight. Its to make money Reply reply RedshiftWarp • 1h ago You aint cool enough to fight Mike Tyson if you didnt face his digital demon in punchout first. Reply reply MarcoVinicius • 16h ago It’s kinda disgusting Netflix thought any of this was a good idea. Reply reply luri7555 • 16h ago I hope Jake tapes his ears on.
