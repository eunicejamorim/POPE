Senior Manager Mugdha grew up in Mumbai, India and has made Bangalore her home over the last five years. She worked in Consulting before moving to Amazon in 2017 for a role with the Customer Experience and Business Trends (CXBT) team. While she worked with retail and consumer goods clients in her consulting career, the online retail space in India was a completely new world for her. She loves being a part of such a fast-paced environment and enjoys working with the unique challenges in a market like India. This CXBT team has given her the unique opportunity to work with several different Amazon business areas in India such as Retail Category Teams, Amazon Pay, Operations, Prime, Alexa, and more. She learns something new with every project and appreciates the opportunity to influence so many different aspects of the customer experience. She enjoys being part of the team that is serving the ever-evolving preferences of customers in India. She believes Amazon is among the unique workplaces where every person, irrespective of level or role, is always focusing on the customer. “ Being a customer advocate in an environment like this is a truly fulfilling experience .” Mugdha is excited about her work every day at Amazon and looks forward to all that is coming.
