About Reverso Reverso for Business Newsletter Contact Us English English Français Español Deutsch Italiano Português Русский Română Český 中文 Reverso - Privacy Policy The purpose of this Privacy Policy is to inform you of the means that Reverso uses to process your personal data, while respecting your rights. It is possible to use Reverso sites or products without sharing personal data, but some features require a mandatory registration for which the identifier is a validated email address or Apple ID. As a European company, Reverso complies, in the collection and management of your personal data, with the GDPR that came into effect in May 2018 . Article 1 - Acceptance of rules concerning the use of personal data By using any of the Reverso sites or products, you acknowledge that you have read and agree to these rules regarding the use of personal data. If you disagree with them, please do not access the Reverso sites. Article 2 – Identity of the data collector The person responsible for collecting your personal data is Reverso SAS, a simplified joint stock company with a capital of €42,500, registered with the Trade and Companies Register of NANTERRE under number 335 309 993, whose registered office is located at 5, rue Soyer 92200 NEUILLY-SUR-SEINE. You can contact our Data Protection Officer (or DPO) at dpo@reverso.com . Article 3 – Nature of personal data Personal data includes any personally identifiable information that you deliberately provide when registering on one or more Reverso sites or products or that will be used in connection with your use of the Reverso sites. Personal data includes "registration data", "usage data", “activity data” and “user contributions”: a - Registration data The registration data corresponds to the fields you fill in when you create or update your Reverso account. A validated, personal and not “temporary” email address is mandatory. Other data may be requested on an optional basis, such as your first name, last name, occupation, language, date of birth. First and last names are considered private data. They will be available publicly if you contribute to the collaborative dictionary or on the Expressio website. If you do not want to make this data publicly available, it is up to you not to enter your first and last name. In this case, only your username will be displayed. b - Usage data Usage data is automatically stored when you navigate on Reverso’s websites in order to provide you with a personalized experience. For example, Reverso Translator is automatically set on the last language pair you used, Reverso Documents allows you to see the list of translation jobs you have performed with details such as the date, source language, target language, number of words, etc. This information also allows Reverso Documents to calculate the remaining credits on your account. Without such collected information, Reverso may not be able to provide you with the best user experience on its websites. To achieve that, Reverso collects log data and cookies, described in Article 8, even if you haven’t created a Reverso account or logged in yet. Reverso uses Google Analytics as an audience measurement tool to follow aggregated statistics and level of engagement, such as the number of visits on its pages, number of clicks, etc. For more information, you can consult Google’s Privacy and terms accessible via this link . Reverso also stores an anonymous history of spelling mistakes corrected on its Speller in the purpose of analyzing this data and improving the provided services. c – Activity data When you are not logged in, no personal data is stored by Reverso. When you are logged in on Reverso’s Translation, Conjugation or Speller sites, no personal data is collected either. When you are logged in on Context or Synonyms, Reverso stores your search history , so that you can review and learn from it. You can mark an item as a favourite or choose to delete it. Your list of favorite items is stored by Reverso and you can access it on the Favourite page under your Account and synchronized across all your devices. By default, your favourites list is private and only you have access to it. However, you can choose to make it public, in this case anyone you share the link with can view your list (but cannot modify it). On Reverso Documents, your uploaded files and their translations are temporarily stored by Reverso to allow you to revise them online. This feature is very handy for proof-reading before downloading the translated document, as it allows you to see the texts in the original language and the target language side by side. The modifications you bring to the translated segments are stored in your Translation Memory, which will be used, only for your account, in the following documents. You can choose to disable this feature when launching a new translation. Your documents are accessible from your Dashboard . You can choose to share them with any reviewer you invite by email; the Reverso Documents’ support team can access them if you request help on a specific translation project. You can also choose to delete the project, which will permanently delete it from all our servers, as described in Article 6. In conclusion, your activity data is considered as highly confidential and no third-party can have access to it unless you share it with them. d – User Contributions Users wishing to improve Reverso’s services can choose to contribute to the collaborative dictionary, send their suggestions, revisions and feedback.
