He first worked with the band on the Ummagumma, Zabriskie Point and More recordings of 1969, and engineered the Wish You Were Here and Animals albums. In 1974 he became the band's front-of-house sound mixer on their tour late that year, a role he continued in 1975, and in 1977, when he was also the tape effects technician.
