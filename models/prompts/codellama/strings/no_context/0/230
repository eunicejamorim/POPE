The Netflix library grows June has arrived. As usual, with every flip of the calendar, the Netflix catalog expands with more movies and TV shows. This is no different for June 2024, as the month sees a number of notable releases, including Netflix original shows and films and licensed content. Here in this gallery we're rounding up some of the biggest and most anticipated releases for June. This includes a wide array of content, like the seriously excellent animated film The Lego Movie, Oscar-winner Sam Mendes' war movie 1917, the next part of Netflix's Bridgerton series, the Netflix movie Hit Man, and plenty more. Obviously this is all subjective, and your tastes may vary. But we like these TV shows and movies, and you might too. You can find the full list of what's new on Netflix in the last slide. Happy watching!

Directed by Twin Peaks legend David Lynch and starring Kyle MacLachlan, Dune was not a success when it debuted-- Lynch took issue with the studio cut and disowned it --but has since amassed a cult following. The Lego Movie and Lego Batman Movie – June 19 The Lego Movie and The Lego Batman Movie are highly regarded animated films, and you can watch them both on Netflix starting on June 19. Chris Pratt and Elizabeth Banks provide the voices of the main characters in The Lego Movie, and the film is remembered in part for its uplifting story and the inescapable "Everything Is Awesome" song. The Lego Batman movie, meanwhile, features Will Arnett as the voice of Batman, Michael Cera as Robin, and Zach Galifniakis as the voice of Joker. Need we say more? Detective Pikachu – June 1 While fans of 2019's Detective Pikachu are not getting the sequel they want yet, they can at least watch the first movie again when it comes to Netflix on June 1. The movie features Ryan Reynolds as the voice of Pikachu, and while that sounds odd, it works--and it works well. Justice Smith, Kathryn Newton, Bill Nighy, and Rita Ora also star in the film directed by Rob Letterman. Crazy Rich Asians – June 6 2018's Crazy Rich Asians did well at the box office when it came out, and soon you'll be able to watch it on Netflix when it arrives on June 6. This is a well-written romantic comedy with drama mixed in, featuring a stellar cast that includes Constance Wu, Henry Golding, Awkwafina, Michelle Yeoh, Gemma Chan, and Ken Jeong. 1917 – June 1 The World War I movie 1917 from James Bond director Sam Mendes is fantastic and haunting. The film, which is based on stories told to Mendes by his grandfather, is especially gripping in part because it was filmed to look like one continuous shot--in essence, it's a two-hour "oner." Two British soldiers, played by George MacKay and Dean-Charles Chapman, are called upon to deliver a message to help prevent allies from taking part in a mission they won't win. The journey to deliver this message is harrowing, and the cinematography from Roger Deakins is astounding. The film won three Oscars, including Best Achievement in Cinematography. Bridgerton S3, Part 2 – June 13 If you're caught up with Bridgerton's newest season, you're no doubt very much looking forward to Part 2 of Season 3's release on June 13. Part 1 enjoyed huge ratings and expectations for the second wave of four episodes are high. Part 1 ended on a cliffhanger and high drama between Penelope and Colin, and fans are no doubt hoping Part 2 pays things off in a satisfying way. Dexter Season 1-8 – June 19 Showtime's popular crime drama Dexter, which ran for eight seasons, comes to Netflix on June 19. The show stars Michael C. Hall as forensic technician Dexter Morgan for the Miami Police Department, who lives a double life as a murderer outside of work hours. The story is more complicated than that, and the series gets increasingly intense as the seasons go on. The early seasons are beloved--including the adored Season 4 with John Lithgow's Trinity killer–but many fans say when showrunner Clyde Phillips left after Season 4, the show began to fall off. Aftersun – June 21 2022's Aftersun from director Charlotte Wells is a highly regarded drama starring Paul Mescal and Frankie Corio. Both turned in memorable performances in Wells' feature film debut depicting the relationship between father and daughter. Mescal earned an Academy Award nomination for his performance. Mescal's star continues to shine brighter and he will be seen next in Ridley Scott's highly anticipated Gladiator 2. Carol – June 17 2015's drama Carol from director Todd Haynes comes to Netflix on June 17, and it's well worth your consideration. Starring Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, the movie tells the story of two women in 1950s New York who fall in love but run into issue after issue preventing them from being together. The film also features Sarah Paulson and Kyle Chandler. It was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Performance in leading and supporting roles for Blanchett and Mara. HIMYM Seasons 1-9 – June 3 How I Met Your Mother is one of the most popular and beloved TV shows ever, and soon, it'll be on Netflix. All 208 episodes come to Netflix on June 19, so you'll be able to see the story from beginning to end to understand completely how it was that Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor) met his wife. HIMYM also stars Neil Patrick Harris, Cobie Smulders, Alyson Hannigan, and Jason Segel. Hit Man – June 7 Glen Powell's next big movie is Hit Man. A Netflix original film, Hit Man releases on June 7 and tells the sort-of-true story of an undercover New Orleans agent posing as a hitman who arrests the people who hire him. A woman hires him for his services, and wouldn't you know it, he falls in love with her! The film is directed by Richard Linklater (Boyhood) and is based in part on a 2001 Texas Monthly magazine article. The Conjuring 1-3 – June 1 The Conjuring movies are modern classics in the horror genre, some might say, and they're coming to Netflix on June 1. Starring Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as supernatural investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, these films are extremely unsettling and eerie--and they're very good. If you enjoy them, the good news is they're part of a wider Conjuring universe of films that include The Nun and Annabelle, so there is more to consume. The Breakfast Club – June 1 On June 1, Netflix adds one of the most beloved American movies of all time in The Breakfast Club. The John Hughes-directed coming-of-age film stars Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, and Ally Sheedy as angsty teenagers who are sent to detention where they learn more about each other, and themselves. The film was originally released in 1985 and is regarded as an all-time classic and one of Hughes' best films. The US National Film Registry at the Library of Congress added the movie to its catalog in 2016. Tangerine – June 1 The 2015 comedy-drama Tangerine, from director Sean Baker, hits Netflix on June 1. The film, shot on an iPhone 5S, follows the story of a transgender sex worker who has the great misfortune of discovering her partner has been unfaithful. The movie stars Kitana Kiki Rodriguez, Mya Taylor, and James Ransone. Ultraman Rising  – June 14 A Netflix original animated movie, Ultraman Rising comes to Netflix on June 14. It tells the story of a famous baseball player named Ken Sato, who is secretly a superhero. He's dealt a difficult hand, though, when he's forced to raise a baby kaiju monster after defeating his mother. Sweet Tooth Season 3 – June 6 Eight new episodes of Netflix's Sweet Tooth TV series debut on June 6 for the release of Season 3. For anyone just catching up--first, watch the first two seasons!--Sweet Tooth is a fantasy drama based on a DC comic-book series that takes place in a world where humanity is nearly wiped out and humanoids with animal traits emerge. Christian Convery plays one of the leads, Gus, who is a half-boy/half-deer who embarks on a quest to find his mother. This is the third and final season of Sweet Tooth.
