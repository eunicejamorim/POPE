He didn't drink anything and took Imodium pills in order to avoid having to go to the bathroom during shooting days. Goofs During action scenes, the goggles Paul and the Fremen wear will go from being on during wider shots, to being nowhere to be seen in close-ups. One might think the visors on the goggles are retractable, but there are several shots in which Paul will have his goggles pulled down around his neck. Quotes Gurney Halleck : My lord, the great houses have answered. They refuse to honor your ascendency. Stilgar : We await your orders, Lisan al-Gaib. Paul Atreides : Lead them to paradise. Crazy credits At the start of the film, a Sardaukar priest chants "Power over spice is power over all" as a prologue as it is subtitled onscreen. Connections Featured in The Project: Episode dated 26 February 2024 (2024) Soundtracks House Atreides Written by Hans Zimmer User reviews 2.3K Review Review Featured review 10 / 10 Ladies and gentleman.. the PEAK of filmmaking!! This is the kind of movie that is impossible to do justice, just by talking about it! It is the kind of experience you had once.. but you never thought you would get again.. until this movie proves you WRONG!! This movie takes the aspects of the first movie and improves upon them in almost every way possible, already writing itself into the books of greatest sequels of ALL TIME!! Everything in this movie was TOP notch! Dennis Villeneauve proves why he is not only a master of Sci-Fi movies, but just filmmaking in general! This was a demonstration of power, in what you can achieve with filmmaking! I beg you to watch this on the biggest and best screen you can find! This will be an experience that will stick with you forever! I thought the real Blockbuster was dead.. but I was wrong! This is the cinematic experience i craved! Now I am gonna watch this movie again, and maybe again! Then I am gonna read the books! helpful • 949 407 and_mikkelsen Feb 28, 2024 Top picks Sign in to rate and Watchlist for personalized recommendations Sign in New and Upcoming Sci-fi & Fantasy New and Upcoming Sci-fi & Fantasy From intergalactic travel to happily ever afters, here are the most exciting new stories in science fiction and fantasy.
