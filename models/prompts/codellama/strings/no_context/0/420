SEE DETAILS Home Shop Offers Me Community Stores Billing, Canceling, & Modifying Orders Customer Service Orders & Returns Billing, Canceling & Modifying Orders Billing, Canceling, & Modifying Orders Billing Questions For your own security and protection, Sephora.com will pre-authorize the full amount of your purchase plus applicable sales tax and shipping to verify your billing address and payment information. Any pre-authorization for failed or canceled orders will drop off your account within 1-7 business days depending on your financial institution. Sephora.com will collect payment and post the actual amount of the purchase only when your order is shipped from our warehouse. The Sephora charge will be listed on your credit card bill as: Sephora.com 877-SEPHORA and the total amount charged. Order Status & Modifying Orders Before you place your order, you can view the contents and the total amount in your shopping basket. Once your order is placed, it cannot be modified. If you would like to cancel your order, most orders can be canceled up to an hour after being placed. To check the status of an order, check the Order Details page. Click here for more details about your Order Status You can return your items free of charge for a credit to your account. For more information on returns, please visit our Returns section. Problems with Checkout Billing Information Errors Here are some helpful suggestions if you receive the following error messages on the Billing Information page: Error Message – "The billing information that you entered does not match your credit card information. Please verify your billing information to ensure that it matches your credit card billing address (i.e., street/city/state/zip address must match EXACTLY)." If you receive this message after you have attempted to submit your order, you may want to check the following: Ensure that there are no typos or misspellings with your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. Verify that your billing address on your credit card bill is exactly the same as you have entered. Call your issuing bank to ensure that your bank has recently updated their online transaction database. In some cases, the address they have entered into their online address verification system is outdated. You may want to try an old address, because in some cases, it takes a while for banks to update their information. Addresses up to two years old can be authorized successfully. **Please be aware that with each submission, you may place another hold on your funds for the total amount of the order. In many cases, submission with a valid credit card number with an incorrect billing address will still result in a hold on your account. If this occurs, please note that those authorizations will drop off your account within 2 - 4 business days depending on your issuing bank. Please contact your bank for further questions. Partially Canceled Orders Out of Stock Item After Order has been Placed If an item in your order is out of stock after your order has been placed, that item will be canceled from your order and you will receive a notification via email. All in-stock items in your order will be shipped to you. If you placed the initial order as a Beauty Insider or the initial order you placed met the $50 minimum threshold for free standard shipping via guest checkout, but part of your order was canceled by Sephora, the order will still ship for free. If you would like to be notified when the item is back in stock, please visit the product page and sign up for the “email me when in stock” alert. Orders that contain out-of-stock items will be partially canceled for US and Canada Sephora.com orders only. Beauty Insider Points and Partially Canceled Order Beauty Insider Points are awarded for all merchandise that is purchased. If an item is canceled from your order, you will not receive Beauty Insider points for that item. Beauty Insider Rewards and Partially Canceled Order Beauty Insider Rewards are shipped with merchandise orders. If the item that is canceled from your order drops your Beauty Bank below the required points to redeem the reward, you will still receive the reward as long as other merchandise is being shipped. Points will be deducted from your Beauty Bank account for the reward. It is possible your Beauty Bank could have a negative balance if you do not have enough points in your account because of the item cancellation. If your entire order is canceled, the Beauty Insider Reward will not ship because a merchandise purchase is required. Samples, Sample Bag or Other Promotional Items and Partially Canceled Order Samples, Sample Bags and all other promotional items are shipped with merchandise orders only. If part of your order is canceled, the Samples, Sample Bag and/or other promotional items in your order will ship with your merchandise order. If your entire order is canceled, the Samples, Sample Bag and other promotional items will not ship because a merchandise purchase is required. Shipping Fee and Partially Canceled Order If you placed your order as a Beauty Insider and part of your order was canceled by Sephora, the order will still ship for free. If you placed an order as a guest and met the $50 minimum threshold for standard shipping, your order will still ship for free if it was partially canceled by Sephora.
