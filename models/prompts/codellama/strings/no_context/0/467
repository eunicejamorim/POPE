API Plans and pricing Apps free Start free trial Login We take security seriously More than 500,000 professionals worldwide use DeepL Pro to ensure the confidentiality and security of their data. We protect your data with the highest security measures Data encryption All data transferred between DeepL Pro subscribers and DeepL infrastructure is encrypted using state-of-the-art TLS encryption. We regularly review the cipher suites used and deprecate those which may become insecure in the future. Data storage DeepL Pro subscribers’ texts aren’t saved on persistent storage, but only stored in RAM. Translations of document files are only saved on disk temporarily for the execution of the translation. In this case, they are encrypted using state-of-the-art symmetrical encryption, with the key only stored in volatile memory and on the subscriber’s system. DeepL Pro subscribers’ texts are not used to train our models. Additionally, DeepL Pro subscribers’ glossary entries are saved in persistent storage to guarantee cross-platform ubiquity, whereas free users’ entries are only stored in the browser’s local storage.
