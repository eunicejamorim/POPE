View open roles Voices of IMDb I work on the Events team at IMDb as a Senior Event Producer. This means I manage cross-team programs for a number of events, including Sundance Film Festival, South by Southwest, and San Diego Comic-Con, as well as sponsorships of events, including the American Black Film Festival and Independent Spirit Awards. These events include on-the-ground programs and digital programs across IMDb.com. My work prior to IMDb was solely with a small agency, so I was blown away with the resources that became available to me once I started working for a company like Amazon. Working at IMDb allows me to have a close connection within the Amazon network with like-minded and movie-obsessed coworkers.” Maddie Senior Event Producer I work on the Originals team at IMDb as a Video Producer. I write, produce, and program original and social content for the biggest shows, movies, and festivals, including Sundance, the American Black Film Festival, and San Diego Comic-Con. This includes interviewing A-list and trending celebrities. This programming is featured on IMDb’s social accounts and IMDb.com. Prior to IMDb, I worked in daytime television as a producer and booker. I love how the IMDb team is truly movie, TV, and customer-obsessed. I feel inspired by my peers and the resources available at Amazon to challenge how we ideate and create content that impacts multiple age demographics, communities, and all movie and TV lovers.” Tre Video Producer I’m a movie lover at heart, so getting the job at IMDb was a dream turned reality. As an Event Producer, I’m responsible for building, executing, and scaling cross-functional programs, events, and sponsorship campaigns from concept to completion. I’m able to work backwards from a customer’s goal and provide measurable results. I love being an IMDb/Amazon employee because I’m able to constantly learn skills from those around me. I’m encouraged by my manager and coworkers to think big, take risks, and innovate. I’m surrounded by people who are passionate about the work they do and have a great time doing it.” Myra Event Producer Working at IMDb Hear from our employees about why they love working at IMDb.
