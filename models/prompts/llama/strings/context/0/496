It is also extremely important for engineers to understand what allows a sound to be heard in the way it is, what makes speech intelligible, and how a particular sound is recognized within a multitude of sounds. Acoustic Signals and Hearing: A Time-Envelope and Phase Spectral Approach is unique in presenting the principles of sound and sound fields from the perspective of hearing, particularly through the use of speech and musical sounds. Acoustic Signals and Hearing: A Time-Envelope and Phase Spectral Approach is an ideal resource for researchers and acoustic engineers working in today’s environment of media technology, and graduate students studying acoustics, audio engineering, and signal processing.
