NEAR has seen a one-week price drop of 6.51% and a one-month price increase of 8.49%. Despite the recent dip, it boasts a six-month price change of 330.93%. The nearest resistance level is at $8.88 and support is at $6.80. With an RSI of 45.90 and MACD level of -0.04, the price movement appears corrective. Ondo (ONDO) Price Overview: Significant Growth with Strong Potential Ondo (ONDO) is currently trading between $0.96 and $1.41. The coin has shown considerable gains, with a one-week change of 27.64%, a one-month increase of 56.02%, and an impressive six-month rally of 4034.23%. The RSI stands at 52.85, suggesting neutral momentum. The next resistance level is at $1.59, and support is at $0.69. Given the recent price movements, ONDO remains in an impulsive phase. Internet Computer (ICP) Price Overview and Prediction ICP is currently trading between $11.29 and $13.35. It faces resistance at $14.64 and has support at $10.52. The next levels are at $16.70 for resistance and $8.46 for support. The 10-day SMA is $12.22, and the 100-day SMA is $12.24. With an RSI of 44.44 and a Stochastic of 21.48, the coin has a MACD level of -0.02. The one-week price change decline is 10.76%, and the one-month drop is 8.88%. Over six months, it’s up 167.92%. The price is in a corrective move. Injective (INJ) Crypto Price Overview Injective (INJ) is currently trading in the range of $22.67 to $27.99. Despite a drop of 11.01% in the past week, INJ has fallen just 3.08% over the past month and gained 49.86% over six months, signaling long-term growth. The nearest resistance level is at $31.18, with support at $20.54. Technical indicators like RSI at 45.51 and MACD at -0.10 suggest the price is in a corrective move. Conclusion NEAR, ONDO, ICP, and INJ may see less growth in the short term. CYBRO stands out for its unique earn marketplace, which uses the yield potential of the Blast blockchain. Its first release is planned for Q2 2024. Early investors have a good chance to join the CYBRO token presale and enter the project on favorable terms.
