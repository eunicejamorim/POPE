Whether you have a favorite brand or need help finding the perfect match, Sephora is your No.1 destination for everything beauty. If youâ€™re looking for the best makeup (and we know you are), a good place to start is with our bestsellers . Read thousands of reviews from fellow makeup-lovers and find top rated products for your beauty routine. If youâ€™re still having a hard time finding the perfect product, check out our buying guides and quizzes or consult millions of users in our Sephora Community . Make sure you have a solid foundation with the perfect primer â€“ this will ensure that the rest of your face makeup goes on smoothly and lasts longer. Next, itâ€™s time for concealer. Some of the most popular foundation brands include NARS, Stila and Fenty. Add some color with a contour palette. Start with a darker, matte shade that simulates a shadowed-look and enunciates your cheekbones. Next, add some warmth with a bronzer in a C-shape along your hairline. Finally, apply blush for that perfect rosy look. Some of the best face palette brands include Tarte and Anastasia Beverly Hills. Whether you want a natural or dramatic look can depend heavily on your eye makeup. For a natural look, stick to mascara, a very light eyeshadow (if any) and a boy brow. Make sure to get a good lengthening and volumizing mascara for extra lash definition. For a dramatic look, the options are endless. Youâ€™ll definitely need some liquid eyeliner, the perfect palette and all of the brushes necessary to get started. Try some of the top eye makeup brands like Urban Decay, KVD Vegan Beauty and Too Faced. Last, but not least â€“ donâ€™t forgot those lips ! A more subdued look may only require some lip gloss or a shade thatâ€™s closer to your skin tone. For fuller looking lips, make use of the right lip liner and some plumping gloss. You can always make your lips stand out with a bold shade in whatever finish suits your look, whether it be glossy or matte. A couple of our favorite brands are Huda Beauty and Buxom. If youâ€™re looking for organic makeup , we also have a wide variety with Clean at Sephora. And â€“ donâ€™t forget â€“ you can find ALL of these beauty products in our own stunning Sephora Collection . Interested in learning how to achieve a certain makeup look?
