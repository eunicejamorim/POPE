Close I already donated Close Welcome to Wikipedia , the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit . 6,830,375 articles in English From today's featured article Hall's A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary John Richard Clark Hall (1855–1931) was a British scholar of Old English , and a barrister. Hall's A Concise Anglo-Saxon Dictionary (pictured) became a widely used work upon its 1894 publication, and after multiple revisions remains in print. His 1901 prose translation of Beowulf was still the canonical introduction to the poem into the 1960s; some later editions included a prefatory essay by J. R. R. Tolkien . Hall's other work on Beowulf included a metrical translation in 1914, and the translation and collection of Knut Stjerna 's Swedish papers on the poem in the 1912 work Essays on Questions Connected with the Old English Poem of Beowulf . In the final decade of his life, Hall's writings took to a Christian theme. The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge published two of his works in this time: Herbert Tingle, and Especially his Boyhood , and Birth-Control and Self-Control . Hall worked as a clerk at the Local Government Board in Whitehall , becoming principal clerk in 1898.
