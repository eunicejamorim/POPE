The ground was pink and colourful umbrellas swung above and it was the sort of atmosphere we had been looking for in Lisbon and had yet to find until now. Barrio Alto and the pink street was our favourite spot and wished we had spent more time here than wasting a day in Alfama.

If the line is long to get them fresh, you can grab a box to go and they are just as delish.  This is a must stop while visiting Lisbon, especially if you are visiting St Jerome Monastery.

It's a small station and has toilets and a supermarket. Very easy to navigate!

Whilst on a boat trip we got to see this bridge up close and watch the sunset upon it which was just magical!
