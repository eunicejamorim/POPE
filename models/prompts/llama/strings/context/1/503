Everything you read on wikiHow was written by someone who wanted to help someone else. Steps Why should you choose wikiHow first? {"smallUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/e\/e2\/How_it_works-%281%29.jpg\/460px-How_it_works-%281%29.jpg","bigUrl":"\/images\/thumb\/e\/e2\/How_it_works-%281%29.jpg\/670px-How_it_works-%281%29.jpg","smallWidth":460,"smallHeight":173,"bigWidth":670,"bigHeight":252,"licensing":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p>License: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/\">Creative Commons<\/a><br>\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<\/p><\/div>"} Why should you choose wikiHow first? Because we put our hearts into giving you the most helpful how-to guides on the Internet. Most publishers have just one lonely author crank out an article and call it good. In contrast, the average wikiHow article has been edited by 23 people and reviewed by 16 people . Look for articles with the green checkmark as those articles received an additional layer of review. When you see the green expert checkmark on a medical article, you know an actual doctor reviewed a version of it. Similarly, veterinarians review our pet articles and lawyers review legal articles. Find a list of wikiHow's Medical, Legal, Financial and other Expert Article Reviewers here. We don’t stop there. We’re constantly improving what you see on wikiHow. We monitor the feedback readers leave on each article. If an article is accurate but incomprehensible, we rewrite it. If our illustrations don’t simplify the complex, we redraw them. In fact the average wikiHow article gets changed 9 times per year. Even after readers shower an article with praise, we find ways to make it even better. We never stop. So you see, wikiHow isn’t just the work of one person. It’s the combined effort of many. Thousands of volunteers, the largest team of illustrators on the web, hundreds of photographers, and over 1700 credentialed experts are continually working and reworking articles till they are the most helpful and reliable how-to guides on the web.
