Cancel Update Custom Duties and Taxes for the European Union Etsy collects VAT from EU buyers on orders that meet the following criteria: The purchase is for a physical item The item is delivered to a location in the EU The goods are dispatched from outside the EU The total value of the package (including gift wrap but excluding delivery) is less than or equal to €150 Etsy also collects VAT when the seller is located outside of the EU but is shipping goods that are located within the EU (regardless of value). VAT is applied to the full order total which includes item price, postage, and gift wrap charges. For orders over €150 imported into the EU, customs duties and VAT will be collected by the postal operator at delivery. How VAT appears at checkout If you set your region on Etsy to a country in the EU, you’ll see VAT included on the item price for listings under €150 from shops outside the EU. If the item is being shipped from the EU, but the seller is located outside the EU, you’ll see VAT included on the listing’s item price and at checkout. Keep in mind, the VAT shown before purchase is an estimated value. The final amount of VAT charged by Etsy will be calculated at checkout and is determined by several things, including: The seller’s location Where the item is being shipped from Where the item is being shipped to The type of item you’re buying the VAT rate on those types of items in the country you’re shipping to Learn more about VAT on physical items . Etsy also collects VAT on the sale of digital items delivered via automatic download to buyers in the EU. Learn more about VAT on digital items .
