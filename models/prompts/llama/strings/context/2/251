Hot Hits UK The UK's biggest playlist. Cover: Shaboozey About #4 in the world 88,686,490 monthly listeners Billie Eilish remains one of the biggest stars to emerge in the 21st century. Her third studio album, HIT ME HARD AND SOFT features 10 tracks written and recorded in her hometown of Los Angeles, with her brother and producer FINNEAS. In 2019, her debut album WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO? debuted at No. 1 in 18 countries, and was the most streamed album of that year. In 2021, her sophomore album 'Happier Than Ever‚Äô debuted at #1 in 20 countries. Both albums were critically acclaimed worldwide and were written, produced, and recorded entirely by Billie Eilish and FINNEAS. 9-time GRAMMY¬Æ Award-winning Billie Eilish has made history as the youngest artist to receive nominations and win in all the major GRAMMY¬Æ categories, receiving an award for Best New Artist, Album of the Year, Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Pop Vocal Album, and is the youngest artist to write and record an official James Bond theme song, ‚ÄòNo Time To Die,‚Äô which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2022. In 2023, Eilish also wrote and released the critically acclaimed song ‚ÄúWhat Was I Made For?‚Äù for the Greta Gerwig-directed motion picture Barbie, which also won Academy and Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, two GRAMMY¬Æ Awards for Song of the Year and Best Song Written For Visual Media, and has solidified Billie Eilish yet again in the history books as the youngest person ever to win two Academy Awards. Merch HIT ME HARD AND SOFT Standard Vinyl Billie Eilish‚Äôs third studio album, "HIT ME HARD AND SOFT", released via Darkroom/Interscope Records is her most daring body of work to date, a diverse yet cohesive collection of songs‚Äî ideally listened to in its entirety from beginning to end‚Äîdoes exactly as the album title suggests; hits you hard and soft both lyrically and sonically, while bending genres and defying trends along the way. With the help of her brother and sole collaborator, FINNEAS, the pair wrote, recorded, and produced the album together in their hometown of Los Angeles. This album comes on the heels of her two massively successful albums ‚ÄúWHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?" and "Happier Than Ever" and works to further develop the world of Billie Eilish. 1LP in gatefold jacket Tracklist A-Side 1.
