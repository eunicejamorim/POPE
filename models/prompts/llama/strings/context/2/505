Determine whether you will offer customers a product or a service. Focus on a quality or feature that makes your product or service stand apart from competitors. Put together a prototype of your product or a working model of your business that focuses on this quality. If you intend to open a sweet shop, your working model might be tricky.

Introduce your product or service to a larger market than when you first tested it. Encourage customer feedback to determine if further changes are necessary. The goal is to put together a modest but functioning business model. This will help you entice investors so that you can properly develop your business. Don’t be afraid to take risks as you expand your market. {"smallUrl":"https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/images\/thumb\/a\/aa\/Act-Like-a-Businessman-Step-5-Version-2.jpg\/v4-460px-Act-Like-a-Businessman-Step-5-Version-2.jpg","bigUrl":"\/images\/thumb\/a\/aa\/Act-Like-a-Businessman-Step-5-Version-2.jpg\/aid1648888-v4-728px-Act-Like-a-Businessman-Step-5-Version-2.jpg","smallWidth":460,"smallHeight":345,"bigWidth":728,"bigHeight":546,"licensing":"<div class=\"mw-parser-output\"><p>License: <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\" class=\"external text\" href=\"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-nc-sa\/3.0\/\">Creative Commons<\/a><br>\n<\/p><p><br \/>\n<\/p><\/div>"} 6 Raise start-up money. Create a detailed proposal for potential investors. This should include basic information on your product or service. It should also include ideas for expansion and development.

Obtain the necessary business licenses and insurance. You may need to have an adult co-sign your public liability insurance documents or other documentation if you are under 18. Make sure to hire someone to manage your accounting. It’s important to know how your business is doing financially in order to make smart investments and stay in business. Advertise your business as necessary and ask clients for referrals. Network with other business owners to leverage your market share.

Determine how much your business is worth. Look for a buyer or group of buyers. Talk to people you know and ask them if they are interested or might know people who are. Senior employees may be interested in buying the business. Negotiate a fair price and create an exit strategy for your departure.
