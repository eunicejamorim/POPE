We do not store your payment credentials. They are encrypted and passed to Braintree (owned by PayPal) through their API that we use to process all payments. This API allows us to create a protected link to the payment method when you purchase anything on our website. Thus, we provide a safe, easy, and secure way to make subscriptions on our site. How can I pay for a TradingView subscription? Acceptable payment methods include all major credit cards, PayPal accounts, Apple Pay, and crypto payments. Additionally, on our mobile apps, you can use any payment method supported by the App Store or Google play . Can I pay with crypto? You can pay with crypto (BTC, ETH, USDC, USDT, BCH, LTC, DOGE, DAI, Matic) for annual plans only. Coinbase handles payment processing for us. To pay with crypto, you'll need to switch on the ‚ÄúCrypto‚Äú tab on the Order page and follow the instructions. Can I cancel anytime? You can cancel your subscription anytime and it will not auto-renew after the current paid term. Paid service will remain active for the duration of the paid term. A canceled trial will stop immediately after cancellation. What is your Refund Policy? There are no refunds for initial orders (i.e. first-time purchases) and there are no refunds for monthly plans. Refunds are available only after an automatic deduction for annual payments (i.e. after trial and after renewal) within 14 calendar days after the payment was made. How does upgrading without payment work? You can upgrade your annual subscription at any time with no extra transactions needed. All remaining days of your current plan will be automatically converted into equivalent value days on the new tier. You don't lose anything, just use the remaining amount to switch to a better version. Thus, the remaining period of your subscription will be reduced and your next payment date will be switched. Learn more about upgrades. How does downgrading work? If you downgrade, your current plan will stay exactly as it is until its subscription date. Then, once it expires, your new downgraded plan will go live at the selected rate. Learn more about downgrades. How can I get extra real-time data? All extra real-time and intraday data for exchanges ‚Äî NASDAQ, NYSE, NYSE ARCA, OTC, CME, etc. ‚Äî are available to be added separately to your account. To add data, you first need to have one of our paid plans or to be a trial member. Take a look at all the global data available to you. Will extra real-time data also work on TradingView widgets? No. Extra real-time data is only available on the TradingView website and only for users who purchased the data from eligible exchanges with their paid TradingView account. What is the difference between professional and non-professional subscriptions? In general, ‚ÄúProfessional‚Äùusage relates to common business activity where market data is used on behalf of businesses or entities, funds or asset managers. ‚ÄúNon-Professional‚Äù usage refers to market data for personal use only. This means that any person who uses market data as a retail customer or market hobbyist is a Non-professional user while those who use market data on behalf of an employer or engages in the trading between businesses or entities, is considered to be a Professional user. Detailed information is here . Can I still buy a professional plan if I'm not a professional trader? Yes, sure! Our professional plans have plenty of features, including more alerts, data, multiple charts, and more. If you need more than non-professional plans provide, you can purchase any of the professional ones, even if you are not a professional trader.
