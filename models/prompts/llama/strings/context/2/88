We provide a platform (the “Platform”) that
    encompasses (1) a variety of services, including TurboTax, QuickBooks, and
    Credit Karma (each, a “Service”); and (2) installable software (including
    our desktop and mobile applications), any accompanying documentation, and
    any updates to such software or documentation (collectively, “Software”). Intuit Consumer Group LLC, along with any parent, subsidiary, affiliate, or
    related companies (including those listed here and at
    https://www.intuit.com/legal/intuit-group-companies/) are referred to in
    these provisions as “Intuit Group Companies” or simply “Intuit” or “us.” When you use the Platform, you enter into a binding contract with us. Each
    section of the agreement begins with an italicized annotation that is
    intended to help you navigate the agreement.  The annotations do not
    completely summarize the agreement, though, and you should read each section
    carefully and in full.  We’ve also bolded a few areas that talk about
    important legal rights, and you should be sure to read those sections
    carefully.  These provisions in Section A apply to the Platform generally
    and are separate from the provisions in Section B which include additional
    provisions for your use of specific Intuit Software or Services. If you are an individual acting on your company’s or client’s behalf, you
    accept these provisions on their behalf and the term “you” will refer to
    you, your company, or your client. Agreement to These Terms You need to agree to these terms to use our Platform. By using the Platform,
    you are instructing us to share your data across our Platform for marketing,
    eligibility, and other purposes described in our Global Privacy Statement , consistent with applicable law.  This data may include credit information
    and other information we obtain from third parties. To access and/or use the Platform, you acknowledge and agree: To the terms and conditions of this agreement (“Agreement”), which includes: Intuit’s Global Privacy Statement ; The current version of the terms set out in Section A and Section B; and Any additional provisions and conditions provided separately to you for your
    use of the Platform, which may include terms and conditions from third
    parties (which we refer to as “Additional Terms”) You are at least 18 years of age; You are capable of forming a binding contract with Intuit; You are not a person based in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, the Crimea,
    Donetsk (“DNA”), and Luhansk (“LNR”) regions of the Ukraine or any other
    territory that is subject to a government embargo or comprehensive sanctions
    (Russia), or are not otherwise prohibited from using the Platform under the
    laws and regulations of the United States, or any other applicable jurisdiction; and You are not included in lists maintained by the United States or other
    applicable jurisdictions prohibiting transactions maintained by the United
    States or other applicable jurisdictions prohibiting transactions with and
    the export of US products to certain entities, people, and jurisdictions. You understand that by using certain Services, you are providing written
    instructions in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and other
    applicable law to permit Intuit Inc. and its affiliated companies to obtain
    and periodically refresh your credit information and other information about
    you from third parties for marketing, eligibility, and other purposes
    described in Intuit's Global Privacy Statement .
    You understand that your instructions authorize Intuit and its affiliated
    companies to obtain such information now and periodically in the future for
    as long as you have a registered Intuit account.  We will stop refreshing
    your credit information when you cancel your account through your account
    settings. Your Personal Information We want to be transparent about how we use personal information and about
    your rights in our Privacy Statement. You should only provide us with
    personal information of others if you have received permission to do so. You agree that Intuit may use and maintain your personal information
    according to Intuit’s Global Privacy Statement and any changes published by Intuit. To the extent we allow you to input personal information (as the term is
    defined under applicable law) about individuals other than yourself, you
    represent and warrant that you have complied with all applicable laws and
    received the proper authority or consent to allow us to collect and process
    such information to operate our business, in accordance with our Global Privacy Statement .
    You further agree that, other than with respect to information furnished
    to TurboTax in connection with the preparation of an individual or business
    tax return, any sharing of personal information among Intuit Group Companies
    is contemplated as part of the Platform. You agree such sharing does not
    constitute a “sale” of information as defined under the California Consumer
    Privacy Act (CCPA). Changes Change happens. When it does happen, we will update this Agreement. If the
    changes are material, you may need to accept the changes to use the
    Platform. Similarly, there may be circumstances where we need to update or
    discontinue elements of, or individual Services or features within, the
    Platform. We may modify the provisions of this Agreement at any time. We may notify
    you of such modifications by posting through the Platform or on our website
    or by other means. It is important that you review this Agreement whenever
    we modify it because your continued use of the Platform indicates your
    agreement to the modifications. We may modify, suspend or discontinue the
    Platform at any time. You agree that we will not be liable to you or any
    third party for any modification, suspensions or discontinuance of the
    Platform. In some cases, you may need to accept changes to this Agreement to continue
    using the Platform. If you do not agree to the changes, you may stop using
    the Platform or terminate your account. Similarly, we may update the Platform, including with tools, utilities,
    improvements or third party applications. You agree to receive these
    updates. Your Rights to Use the Platform You can use our Platform for your own personal and lawful use or as
    otherwise permitted under this Agreement. Except as set forth in the Section B terms, you may access and use the
    Platform for your own internal, lawful and non-commercial purposes only. Beta Features We may provide you with access to beta features in the Platform. You are
    free to use them, but they are provided as-is. We may include new and/or updated pre-release and trial features in the
    Platform and such features are provided as-is. Your use of such features is
    at no additional cost, but you must follow additional rules or restrictions
    that we may place on their use. Account You will provide accurate, up-to-date account information and securely
    manage such information, including usernames and passwords. You may need to sign up for an account to use the Platform. We may need to
    verify your identity and you authorize us to collect information (e.g., date
    of birth, address) from you to do so (collectively, with all information
    requested to enable your account, “Account Information”).  You will provide
    accurate, up-to-date Account Information, and we disclaim any liability
    arising from your failure to do so. Such failure may further limit your
    ability to use the Platform and affect the Platform's accuracy and
    effectiveness. You are responsible for securely managing your Account Information,
    including any password(s) for the Platform. You will notify us immediately
    if you believe that your Account Information or device you use to access the
    Platform has been lost or stolen or that someone is using your account
    without your permission. From time to time, we may update the Platform, including with tools,
    utilities, improvements or third-party applications. You agree to receive
    these updates. Payment & Cancellations Some Services may be free, others may have costs associated.  For those with
    costs, we may charge your payment method for fees or on a subscription
    basis. You may cancel your subscription at any time (but you may not receive
    a refund). We may require payment of fees or a subscription charge for use of the
    Platform (or certain portions of the Platform) and you agree to pay such
    fees. If you registered for a trial, you may need to purchase the Platform
    before the trial ends in order to retain access to any content provided to,
    or created through, the Platform. Payments will be billed in U.S. dollars, and your account will be charged
    upon purchase and when you provide your payment information, unless stated
    otherwise in applicable payment provisions. If your payment information is
    not accurate, current, and complete, we may suspend or terminate your
    account. If you do not notify us of updates to your payment information, we
    may participate in programs supported by your card provider to try to update
    your payment information, and you authorize us to continue billing your
    account with the updated information that we obtain. You may be charged a subscription fee in advance on an annual basis or other
    recurring interval disclosed to you prior to your purchase.  For annual
    subscriptions, we will send you a reminder with the then-current
    subscription fee no less than thirty (30) days and no more than sixty (60)
    days before your subscription term ends, or otherwise as required by
    applicable law. Intuit may change the price for recurring subscription fees
    from time to time with notice to you. Price changes will take effect at the
    start of the next subscription period following the date of the price
    change. If you do not agree with the price change, you may unsubscribe prior
    to the price change going into effect. Your payment to Intuit will automatically renew at the end of the applicable
    subscription period but you can cancel a subscription at any time. For
    subscription-based versions of the Services, subscription cancellations will
    take effect the day after the last day of the current subscription period.
    If you cancel in the middle of a subscription period, you will be able to
    continue to access and use the applicable Service until the end of your
    subscription period. We do not provide refunds or credits for any
    cancellations or partial subscription period. Desktop and Mobile App Use Desktop and Mobile versions of our Platform may be available for download
    but you must follow applicable third-party terms when using them. The Platform may be available through one or more apps for a compatible
    desktop computer or mobile device. You agree that you are solely responsible
    for any applicable changes, updates and fees as well as complying with the
    provisions of your agreement with your telecommunications provider and any
    third-party mobile app marketplace. With respect to the applicable Software, you are only granted limited rights
    to install and use the Software you have downloaded, signed up for a
    subscription to use, or for which you have purchased a license or acquired a
    free trial. Intuit reserves all other rights in the applicable Software not
    granted to you in writing in this Agreement. Conditioned upon your
    compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including all
    payment obligations), Intuit grants you a personal, limited, nonexclusive,
    nontransferable, revocable license to use the applicable Software only for
    the period of use provided in the ordering and activation terms (as
    applicable), as set forth in this Agreement or in Intuit’s then-current
    product discontinuation policies (as updated from time to time) and only for
    the purposes described by Intuit for the applicable Software. You acknowledge and agree that such Software is licensed, not sold. You may make a single copy of the Software for backup purposes provided that
    you reproduce on it all copyright and other proprietary notices that are on
    the original copy of the Software. You will not delete or in any manner
    alter the copyright, trademark and other proprietary rights notices or
    markings appearing on the Software as delivered to you. Advice and Third-Party Products You may have access to professional advice and third-party products. Any
    such advice and products are not covered under this Agreement. We may offer specific functionality in the Platform that provides you with
    the opportunity to seek professional advice, for example, the ability to
    speak with a tax expert. Unless specifically disclosed, Intuit is not in the
    business of providing legal, financial, accounting, tax, health care,
    insurance, real estate or other professional service or advice, and you
    should consult with professionals for advice prior to making important
    decisions in these areas. The Platform may also include information about (or offers for) third-party
    services or products or allow you to connect your account to or otherwise
    access third-party services or products. Intuit does not warrant, and is not
    responsible for, such third-party services and products or claims made about
    them, or the actions or inactions of any third party.  You must review and
    comply with any Additional Terms. Intuit may be compensated by those third
    parties, which could impact whether, how and where the services and products are displayed. Content and Data What’s yours remains yours, what’s ours remains ours, but we may use
    information you provide to improve our Platform. You are solely responsible for anything you write, submit, receive, share
    and store or any data you input into the Platform (collectively, your
    “Content”). Content includes, but is not limited to, data, information,
    materials, text, graphics, images, audio, video that are uploaded,

    and you’re free to choose the content that you want to provide.  You
    acknowledge certain functionality in the Platform may be dependent on the
    provision of Content and may not be available without such Content. Your Content remains yours, which means that you retain any intellectual
    property rights that you have in your Content. By sharing your Content on
    the Platform, you hereby grant Intuit a license to use your Content, as
    described in more detail below. What’s Covered These licenses cover your Content to the extent your Content is protected by
    intellectual property rights. Scope This license is: worldwide, which means it’s valid anywhere in the world; non-exclusive, which means you can license your Content to others; and royalty-free, which means there are no fees for this license.

    order to train Intuit’s artificial intelligence and machine learning
    technologies. 4. Purpose This license is for the limited purpose of Operating, providing and
    improving the Platform, which means allowing the Platform to work as
    designed and creating new features and functionalities. 5. Duration This license lasts for as long as your Content is protected by intellectual
    property rights. Intuit may collect, derive or generate deidentified and/or aggregated data
    regarding your usage of or the performance of the Platform, including data

    analyzing, improving, or marketing Intuit’s products and services, including
    the Platform. As between you and Intuit, Intuit and its licensors retain all right, title
    or interest in and to the Platform, except for the rights granted to you. Prohibited Uses We expect you to obey the law and follow certain rules in using the
    Platform. Intuit does not condone or support any activity that is illegal, violates
    the rights of others, harms or damages Intuit’s reputation, or could cause
    Intuit to be liable to a third party. At minimum, you may not use the

    actions that give rise to criminal, civil, administrative or regulatory

    used freely by us. The Platform may include a community forum or other social features that
    enable you to exchange Content and information with other users of the
    Platform and the public. Intuit does not support and is not responsible for
    the Content in these community forums. Please be respectful when you
    interact with other users. Do not reveal information that you do not want to
    make public. Users may post hypertext links to content of third parties for
    which Intuit is not responsible. You may provide Intuit your feedback, suggestions, or ideas for the
    Platform. You grant Intuit a perpetual, worldwide, fully transferable,
    sublicensable, irrevocable, fully paid-up, royalty free license to use your
    feedback, suggestions, and ideas in any way, including in future
    modifications of the Platform, other products or services, advertising or
    marketing materials. Chatbots We may use Chatbots to optimize your experience. These technologies are
    evolving and may have limitations. When you use the Platform, you may use or interact with automated features
    like chatbots, digital assistants, conversational experiences powered by
    artificial intelligence, or similar technologies (“Chatbots”). Information
    generated by Chatbots may not be unique. While Chatbots are designed to improve your experience, these technologies
    are evolving and may have limitations such as generating outputs that are
    inaccurate or inappropriate to your situation. Termination You may cancel your account and Intuit may suspend or terminate your use of
    the Platform. For mobile apps, removing the app may not cancel your
    subscription or delete your data. This Agreement is effective until your subscription expires or you cancel
    your account or Intuit terminates this Agreement (or your account). Intuit
    may terminate this Agreement (and your account) or suspend the Platform at
    any time in our discretion. Please note that removing an Intuit mobile app from your device may not
    cancel your subscription or delete your data. If you want to cancel your
    subscription for a Service, please follow the applicable Service
    instructions. If you wish to delete your data from a Service, please log
    into One Intuit Account Manager and follow the instructions under the
    respective data and privacy settings or follow the instructions in our Global Privacy Statement . Effect of Termination You must stop using the Platform once your subscription expires or you
    cancel your account (or if this Agreement or your account is terminated). Upon expiration of your subscription or cancellation of your account, or
    Intuit’s termination of your account or this Agreement, you must immediately
    stop using the Platform and pay all fees for Platform used.  No expiration
    or termination will affect your obligation to pay all fees due or that may
    have accrued through the effective date of expiration or termination or
    entitle you to any refund. Survival There are a few parts of this Agreement that will continue to apply after
    termination. The following Sections will survive any termination, discontinuation or
    cancellation of the Platform or your account: “Your Personal Information,”
    “Payment and Cancellations” (with respect to fees due and unpaid), “Content
    and Data,” “Community Forums; Feedback,” “Effect of Termination,”
    “Disclaimers,” “Limitation of Liability,” “Indemnity Obligations,”
    “Disputes,” and “General Terms (Miscellaneous)”. Intuit Communications We may contact you from time to time to support your use of the Platform. In order to properly support and serve you, we occasionally need to reach
    out and contact you, and may do so in a variety of ways such as via text
    message, email or messaging functionality in the Platform.  We want to
    provide you options for receiving communications from us, and as such you
    may opt-in or opt-out of receiving certain types of communications from us
    or sign up to receive certain kinds of messages from us, depending on the
    Platform. You will need to notify us of any changes to your contact details
    to ensure your preferences are updated. You may provide us with your telephone number as part of your customer
    record or registration or via other methods. You understand and agree that
    Intuit may use your telephone number for multi-factor authentication
    (“MFA”), to confirm your identity and help protect the security of your
    account. Part of the MFA identity verification process may involve Intuit
    sending text messages containing security codes to your telephone number.
    You agree to receive these texts from Intuit containing security codes as
    part of the MFA process. In addition, you agree that Intuit may send
    automated text messages and pre-recorded voice messages to the telephone
    number you provide for other limited purposes, including: providing you with
    important critical notices regarding your use of the Services, or fulfilling
    a request made by you through the Services. Third Party Account Information Intuit is not responsible for any account information obtained from third
    parties. When you direct Intuit to retrieve your account information from third
    parties, you authorize and permit us to use and store that information you
    submit through the Platform (such as usernames and passwords) for purposes
    of providing the Platform and Services to you. You grant Intuit a limited
    power of attorney to access those accounts and retrieve your account
    information, without additional notice to you.  Intuit will be acting as
    your agent and will not be acting on behalf of the third party. Intuit does not review third party account information for accuracy and is
    not responsible for any issues or expenses resulting from such account
    information, including any inaccuracy, error, delay, or non-delivery. For
    clarity, Intuit is not responsible for any payment processing errors or fees
    arising from inaccurate account information provided by third parties. Disclaimers We don’t make any warranties about the Platform except as expressly stated
    in this Agreement. The only warranties we make about the Platform are (1) stated in this
    Agreement, or (2) as provided under applicable laws. The Platform is
    otherwise provided “as-is,” and we do not make any other warranties about
    the Platform. Unless required by law, we do not provide implied warranties,
    such as the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
    purpose, or non-infringement. We do not warrant that the Platform is
    error-free, secure, or free from any viruses or other harmful components. We
    also do not provide any warranties with respect to data loss or to the
    accuracy, reliability, or availability of the Platform, nor of any content
    (including any Content) or information made available in the Platform. If
    the exclusions for implied warranties do not apply to you, any implied
    warranties are limited to sixty (60) days from the date of purchase or
    delivery of the Platform, whichever is sooner. Limitation of Liability Our liability is limited when it comes to issues you may encounter with our
    Platform. Other than the rights and responsibilities described in this Agreement and
    as allowed by applicable law, Intuit won’t be responsible for any losses. The total aggregate liability of Intuit and our third party providers,
    licensors, distributors or suppliers (“Intuit Parties”) arising out of or
    relating to this Agreement is limited to the greater of: (1) the fees that
    you paid to use the relevant Service(s) in the 12 months before the breach
    or (2) $100. The Intuit Parties won’t be responsible for the following: Loss of data, profits, revenues, business opportunities, goodwill or anticipated savings; Indirect, incidental, or consequential loss; Punitive damages; or Damages relating to failures of telecommunications, the internet, electronic
    communications, corruption, security, viruses, or spyware. The above limitations apply even if the Intuit Parties have been advised of
    the possibility of such damages. This Agreement sets forth your exclusive
    remedy with respect to the Platform and its use. If you’re legally exempt from certain responsibilities, including
    indemnification, then those responsibilities don’t apply to you under this
    Agreement. For example, the United Nations enjoys certain immunities from
    legal obligations and this Agreement doesn’t override those immunities. Indemnity Obligations If someone sues us because you used the Platform unlawfully or didn’t follow
    our rules, you will be responsible for any harm to us. You will indemnify and hold harmless the Intuit Parties for any losses,
    damages, judgments, fines, costs and expenses (including legal fees) in
    connection with any claims arising out of or relating to your unlawful or
    unauthorized use of the Platform or violation of this Agreement.  Intuit
    reserves the right, in its sole discretion and at its own expense, to assume
    the exclusive defense and control of any claims. You agree to reasonably
    cooperate as requested by Intuit in the defense of any claims. Disputes In the event we are unable to resolve any dispute through an informal
    dialogue, a third-party arbitrator or small claims court will help us
    resolve any disputes we might have, and any disputes will be resolved on an
    individual basis rather than as a class action. If you are a U.S. customer: You and Intuit agree that, except as provided below, any dispute, claim or
    controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Platform or this
    Agreement (a “Claim”) will be determined by binding arbitration or small
    claims court, instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Either you or Intuit can seek to have a Claim resolved in small claims court
    if all the requirements of the small claims court are satisfied. Either you
    or Intuit may seek to have a Claim resolved in small claims court in your
    county of residence or the small claims court in closest proximity to your
    residence, and you may also bring a claim in small claims court in the
    Superior Court of California, County of Santa Clara. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a
    neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited
    discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts.
    Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.
    You agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation
    and enforcement of this arbitration provision, and that you and Intuit are
    each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class
    action. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this
    Agreement and/or the termination of your account. If you elect to seek arbitration, you must first send to Intuit a written
    notice of your Claim ("Notice of Claim"). The Notice of Claim to Intuit
    should be sent in care of our registered agent Corporation Service Company,
    251 Little Falls Drive, Wilmington, DE 19808. The Notice of Claim should
    include both the mailing address and email address you would like Intuit to
    use to contact you. If Intuit elects to seek arbitration, it will send, by
    certified mail, a written Notice of Claim to your address on file. A Notice
    of Claim, whether sent by you or by Intuit, must (a) describe the nature and
    basis of the Claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific amount of
    damages or other relief sought. You and Intuit agree that good-faith informal efforts to resolve disputes
    often can result in a prompt, low-cost and mutually beneficial outcome. You
    and Intuit therefore agree that, after a Notice of Claim is sent but before
    either you or Intuit commence arbitration or file a Claim in small claims
    court against the other, we will personally meet, via telephone or
    videoconference, in a good-faith effort to confer with each other and try to
    resolve informally any Claim covered by this Agreement. If you are
    represented by counsel, your counsel may participate in the conference as
    well, but you agree to fully participate in the conference. Likewise, if
    Intuit is represented by counsel, its counsel may participate in the
    conference as well, but Intuit agrees to have a company representative fully
    participate in the conference. The statute of limitations and any filing fee
    deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in the informal dispute
    resolution process required by this paragraph. If we do not reach an agreement to resolve the Claim within sixty (60) days
    after the Notice of Claim is received, you or Intuit may commence an
    arbitration proceeding by filing a Demand for Arbitration or, alternatively,
    by filing a Claim in small claims court. You agree that you may not commence
    any arbitration or file a Claim in small claims court unless you and Intuit
    are unable to resolve the Claim within sixty (60) days after we receive your
    completed Notice of Claim and you have made a good faith effort to resolve
    your claim directly with Intuit during that time. If a Claim qualifies for
    small claims court, but a party commences an arbitration proceeding, you and
    Intuit agree that either party may elect instead to have the Claim resolved
    in small claims court, and upon written notice of a party’s election, the
    American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will administratively close the
    arbitration proceeding. Any dispute about whether a Claim qualifies for
    small claims court shall be resolved by that court, not by an arbitrator. In
    the event of any such dispute, the arbitration proceeding shall remain
    closed unless and until a decision by the small claims court that the Claim
    should proceed in arbitration. You may download or copy a form of notice and
    a form to initiate arbitration at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. The arbitration will be conducted by the AAA
    before a single AAA arbitrator under the AAA’s rules, which are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879,
    except as modified by this Agreement. Unless Intuit and you agree otherwise,
    any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of either
    your residence or of the mailing address you provided in your Notice of
    Claim. The arbitrator will be either (1) a retired judge or (2) an attorney
    specifically licensed to practice law in the state of California or the
    state of your residence and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s
    National Roster of Arbitrators. The arbitrator will be selected using the
    following procedure: (a) the AAA will send the parties a list of five
    candidates meeting this criteria; (b) if the parties cannot agree on an
    arbitrator from the list, each party shall return its list to the AAA within
    10 days, striking up to two candidates, and ranking the remaining candidates
    in order of preference; (c) the AAA shall appoint as arbitrator the
    candidate with the highest aggregate ranking; and (d) if for any reason the
    appointment cannot be made according to this procedure, the AAA may exercise
    its discretion in appointing the arbitrator. The arbitrator is bound by this
    Agreement. Except as otherwise provided below, all issues are for the
    arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and
    enforceability of this arbitration provision. The parties agree that an administrative conference with the AAA shall be
    conducted in each arbitration proceeding, and you and an Intuit company
    representative shall appear at the administrative conference via telephone.
    If you fail to appear at the administrative conference, regardless of
    whether your counsel attends, the AAA will administratively close the
    arbitration proceeding without prejudice, unless you show good cause as to
    why you were not able to attend the conference. The arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain
    the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. The
    award shall be binding only among the parties and shall have no preclusive
    effect in any other arbitration or other proceeding involving a different
    party. Intuit will not seek to recover its attorneys’ fees and costs in
    arbitration from you unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance
    of your Claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was
    frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the
    standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)). Judgment on
    any award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This agreement to
    arbitrate shall not preclude any party to the arbitration from at any time
    seeking injunctions or other forms of equitable relief in aid of arbitration
    from a court of appropriate jurisdiction including whether a Demand for
    Arbitration is filed in violation of this Agreement. Unless you or Intuit seek to have a Claim resolved in small claims court,
    the arbitrator shall determine all issues of liability on the merits of any
    Claim asserted by you or Intuit and may award declaratory or injunctive
    relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the
    extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual
    claim. To the extent that you or Intuit prevail on a Claim and seek public
    injunctive relief (that is, injunctive relief that has the primary purpose
    and effect of prohibiting unlawful acts that threaten future injury to the
    public), the entitlement to and extent of such relief must be litigated in a
    civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration. The parties
    agree that litigation of any issues of public injunctive relief shall be
    stayed pending the outcome of the merits of any individual Claims in
    arbitration. Before a court of competent jurisdiction issues any public
    injunctive relief, it shall review the factual findings of the arbitration
    award on which any injunction would issue with no deference to the
    arbitrator. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed
    by the AAA Rules. You are required to pay AAA’s initial filing fee, but
    Intuit will reimburse you for this filing fee at the conclusion of the
    arbitration to the extent it exceeds the fee for filing a complaint in a
    federal or state court in your county of residence or in Santa Clara County,
    California. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your Claim
    or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was
    brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in
    Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be
    governed by the AAA Rules and Intuit will not reimburse your initial filing
    fee. The parties agree that the AAA has discretion to modify the amount or
    timing of any administrative or arbitration fees due under the AAA Rules
    where it deems appropriate, provided that such modification does not
    increase the AAA fees to you or Intuit, and you and Intuit waive any
    objection to such fee modification. You and Intuit agree that each may bring Claims against the other only in
    your or its individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in
    any purported class or representative proceeding. Further, if you have
    elected arbitration, unless both you and Intuit agree otherwise, the
    arbitrator may not consolidate any other person's Claims with your Claims
    and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class
    proceeding. If Intuit believes that any Claim you have filed in arbitration
    or in court is inconsistent with the limitations in this paragraph, then you
    agree that Intuit may seek an order from a court determining whether your
    Claim is within the scope of the Class Action Waiver. If this Class Action
    Waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Disputes
    Section shall be null and void. General Terms (Miscellaneous) This Agreement, including any Section B terms, is the entire agreement
    between you and Intuit and replaces all prior understandings,
    communications, and agreements, oral or written, regarding its subject
    matter. Governing Law The laws of California govern this Agreement and any disputes that may
    arise. California law and the Federal Arbitration Act will govern all disputes
    arising out of or relating to the Platform, this Agreement and any
    Additional Terms, regardless of conflict of laws rules. The United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of
    Goods does not apply to this Agreement. Compliance with Global Trade Laws and Restrictions You are allowed to use the Platform under the laws of the U.S. and other
    applicable territories.  The Platform shall not be exported to jurisdictions
    that are subject to government embargos or comprehensive sanctions. You agree that you and anyone who uses the Platform, including the related
    website, online services and mobile apps, are not prohibited from using the
    Platform under the laws and regulations of the United States or other
    applicable jurisdiction.  For example, You will not use, export, re-export,
    import, sell, release, or transfer the Platform, the Software or the Service
    directly or indirectly, except as authorized by United States law, the laws
    of the jurisdiction where the Platform and Software are made available, and
    any other applicable laws and regulations. In particular, but without
    limitation, the Platform, Software, Services, source code, and technology
    may not be exported, or re-exported, transferred, or released (a) into any
    U.S. embargoed and comprehensively sanctioned jurisdiction  (Cuba, Iran,
    North Korea, Syria and the Crimea, Donetsk (“DNR”), and Luhansk (“LNR”)
    regions of the Ukraine) and Russia; or (b) to anyone included in the U.S.
    Treasury Department’s list of Specially Designated Nationals or on any other
    applicable restricted party lists. You also agree that you will not use the
    Platform, Software and Services for any purposes prohibited by United States
    law. In addition, you certify that neither you nor any principals, officers,
    directors, or any person or entity (including any beneficiaries, owners,
    affiliated and/or associated parties) you know to be directly involved with
    the use of the Platform, Software and the Services are not: (a) on any
    sanctions lists in the countries where the Platform, Software and Services
    are available, (b) doing business in any of the U.S. embargoed countries,
    and (c) a military end user as defined in 15 C.F.R § 744. Government End Users of Software Even if you are a government end user, your rights to Software are limited
    to what is described in this Agreement. The Software is a "commercial item" as that term is defined in FAR 2.101,
    consisting of "commercial computer software," as such term is used in FAR
    12.212 and DFARS 227.7202. If the Software is being acquired by or on behalf
    of the U.S. Government, then, as provided in FAR 12.212 and DFARS 227.7202-1
    through 227.7202-4, as applicable, the U.S. Government’s rights in the
    Software will be only those specified in this Agreement. Waiver If we waive some of our rights under this Agreement, it doesn’t mean we
    waive our rights in other circumstances. Intuit’s failure to act or enforce any of its rights does not constitute a
    waiver of any of our rights. Any waiver by Intuit of any of the provisions
    in the Agreement must be made in writing and signed by a duly authorized
    officer of Intuit. Assignment You can’t transfer this Agreement or your right to use the Platform to
    someone else without our permission. Intuit may assign this Agreement to any party at any time without notice to
    you. You may not assign your rights under this Agreement, by operation of
    law or otherwise, without our consent.  Any attempts to do so without our
    consent will be void. Severability If a court voids a term of this Agreement, the other terms will not be
    affected. If any provision of this Agreement is unlawful, void, or unenforceable for
    any reason, then that provision will be severed and the remaining provisions
    will remain in full force and effect. Contact Information If you have any questions about the Platform or this Agreement, please

    SERVICES The definition of the “Services” includes TurboTax Online (including
    TurboTax Free Edition, Deluxe, and/or Premium), TurboTax Live Assisted and
    TurboTax Live Full Service, QuickBooks Live Assisted Tax, powered by
    TurboTax, QuickBooks Live Full Service Tax powered by TurboTax, the “Powered
    by TurboTax” tax preparation services available through Credit Karma, and
    the TurboTax Non-Tax Preparation Services (as defined below), each of which
    are versions of the Services. The definition of “Services” does not include
    tax preparation, filing, or other services provided by an independent tax
    professional through Intuit TurboTax Verified Pro, which services are
    provided under a separate agreement. Your use of the Services provided by Intuit depends on which version of the
    Services you purchase the right to use (or in the case of free versions of
    the Services, which version you sign up to use) and is subject to the
    General Terms of Service above and these Additional Terms and Conditions,
    both of which govern your use of the Services. These Additional Terms and
    Conditions shall prevail over any conflict or inconsistency with the General
    Terms of Service above. 1. LICENSE GRANT AND RESTRICTIONS 1.1 Personal License. Intuit hereby grants you a limited personal license to
    use the version of the Services for which you have paid Intuit the
    applicable fee(s) (or, in the case of free versions of the Services, for
    which you have signed up) and, after proper registration and acceptance of
    this Agreement, solely to prepare or have prepared your valid 2023 federal
    and state tax return(s), to file the same electronically after any payment
    of applicable additional fees and/or to print such federal and state tax
    return(s); and, in the case of the TurboTax Non-Tax Preparation Services, to
    use such services in accordance with Section 2.7 below. 1.2 Number of Accounts and Returns; Joint Filers. You may use certain
    versions of the Services to self-prepare and electronically file your
    federal tax return and/or your state tax return. After proper registration
    and, where required, payment is made, you may file your return
    electronically or by printing and mailing it to the Internal Revenue Service
    ("IRS") and/or appropriate state agency. Only one federal return may be
    filed per account.  No more than five (5) accounts and five (5)
    corresponding federal returns (e.g., for a family of five or for five
    personal and/or business returns) may be created, purchased and filed using
    any one email address.  You agree that for returns with “married filing
    jointly” filing status, both spouses are deemed to be customers of Intuit
    and subject to the terms of this Agreement. Both individuals acknowledge
    that there is no expectation of privacy between the spouses by Intuit
    concerning the Services, in connection with this Agreement. We shall be at
    liberty to share with either of you, without prior consent of the other,
    partial or completed tax returns, tax documents and other information
    concerning the preparation of your tax return(s). 1.3 No Professional Use. You may not use the Services to prepare tax
    returns, schedules or worksheets on a professional or commercial basis
    (i.e., for a preparer's or other fee or consideration). 2. ADDITIONAL SERVICES 2.1 State Services. The term “Services” includes any state version of
    TurboTax Online software made available through this website, through the
    TurboTax Live Assisted version of the Services, through the TurboTax Live
    Full Service version of the Services (but not state versions made available
    through Intuit TurboTax Verified Pro), through the QuickBooks Live Tax
    Services and/or through the “Powered by TurboTax” tax preparation services
    available through Credit Karma, which state version(s) may be subject to
    additional fees as described on the website. 2.2 Electronic Filing Services. (a.)      If you choose to file your return electronically, the tax return
    will be forwarded to Intuit's Electronic Filing Center, where it will be
    converted to and stored in a standardized format and then transmitted to the
    applicable federal and/or state tax authority. You are responsible for
    verifying the status of your return to confirm that it has been received and
    accepted by the applicable taxing authority and, if necessary, for filing it
    manually (by mail) in the event that the taxing authority rejects your
    electronically filed return. You agree to review your tax return for
    indications of obvious errors before electronically filing or mailing it. To
    the extent required by applicable law and regulation, Intuit stores and
    maintains information that you provide to Intuit. Intuit is not required or
    obligated to provide you with a copy of your tax return if you are using a
    free version of TurboTax or at any time after October 15 of the applicable
    tax filing season (unless otherwise included with the version of TurboTax
    you selected or if required to be provided by law in response to a valid
    data rights request). In the event your tax return is not accessible from
    Intuit and you have not downloaded or otherwise retained a copy, you must
    contact the IRS. (b.)      The IRS typically begins accepting electronically filed returns in
    or around mid-January of the applicable tax filing season. If you complete a
    federal tax return prior to when TurboTax begins accepting and processing
    electronically filed returns and you want to file it electronically, you
    will need to log in to TurboTax Online on or after the date Intuit first
    begins processing electronic filings to complete the electronic filing
    process. You can file a Tax Year 2023 federal tax return through the
    Services through October 15, 2024 or as otherwise permitted by the IRS and
    supported by Intuit. The IRS requires Intuit to notify it, in connection
    with the electronic filing of your tax return, of certain information about
    the computer and account from which the return originated (for example,
    Internet Protocol (“IP”) address) and whether the email address of the
    person electronically filing the return has been collected. By using this
    Service to prepare and submit your tax return, you consent to the disclosure
    to the IRS and any other taxing or revenue authority of all information
    relating to your access and use of the Electronic Filing Services. (c.)      Amended Returns – Individual Returns Only. For paid versions of the
    Services (excluding Business returns), you can file an amended individual
    tax return for Tax Year 2023 through the Services through October 15, 2024
    or as otherwise permitted by the IRS and supported by Intuit. Users of paid
    individual tax return versions of the Services who have used the Services
    for preparing the two immediate prior tax years’ returns and who need to
    file an amended tax return for either of the two immediate prior tax years
    may, at Intuit’s discretion, be provided a link to a downloadable version of
    TurboTax desktop software, and tax information may be able to be transferred
    via your tax data file at no additional cost. For such users of paid
    versions of the Services, your amended return may need to be completed in
    the downloadable version of TurboTax desktop software and not in TurboTax
    Online. You agree to this process for amended individual tax returns and, if
    you choose to utilize it, you agree you will accept the then-current terms
    of the downloadable TurboTax desktop End User License Agreement. Filing of
    amended returns via the Services and/or TurboTax desktop software is not
    included with free or business versions of the Service. (d.)      If you are filing one or more state tax returns, then by using a
    computer system and software to prepare and transmit return(s)
    electronically, you consent to the disclosure of all information pertaining
    to your access and use of the system and software to the state tax authority
    in which you are filing the returns, as applicable by law, and to the
    transmission of your tax return(s) to the applicable state tax authority. (e.)      In the event that you choose to file a federal and/or state tax
    return on behalf of a business entity, you agree that you are an authorized
    representative of the business entity-taxpayer and are legally authorized to
    file on behalf of the entity. 2.3 Pricing. (a)       Pricing for the various versions of the Services is determined based
    on which version of the Services you choose and/or the complexity of your
    tax return and the time when you pay for such version of the Services.
    Depending on the version you choose, this will occur either when starting
    your use of the Services, when the preparation of your return is complete,
    or when your return is otherwise ready to be printed or filed. You
    understand that Intuit may increase the price of any paid version of the
    Services as the respective tax filing deadline approaches and you understand
    and agree that Intuit may increase the price of paid versions of the
    Services if you have not yet already paid for the Services, including after
    you have started your return(s) but not yet completed and paid to print
    and/or efile your return. (b)       For TurboTax Live Assisted and TurboTax Live Full Service, Intuit
    may charge you for these Services before the Services are performed or once
    our expert prepares your return, whether or not you choose to file it. All
    prices are subject to change without notice. If you chose a version of the
    Services that doesn’t require you to pay until your return is prepared and
    ready to file you should confirm whether there have been any changes in
    pricing for your use of that version of the Services since you first started
    using the Services, particularly if some time has passed between the date
    you started your tax return and the date you or Intuit finished preparing it
    and/or you are ready to pay for and file (or print) it. The price for your
    use of various part(s) or version(s) of the Services is the published price
    at the time you pay for such part(s) or version(s) of the Services. Your
    price will not change once you pay for your use of such part(s) or
    version(s) of the Services. 2.4 Import Services. (a)   The Services may include a feature that allows you to import, where
    applicable, certain information from participating financial institutions,
    payroll processors, self-employment and independent worker-matching
    platforms, personal financial software, business financial software such as
    QuickBooks, and charitable deduction information from sources such as
    Intuit’s ItsDeductible service. You are responsible for verifying the
    accuracy of all information that is imported. (b)   The Services also may include functionality designed to read data from
    images (for example, W-2s, other tax forms or credit cards used for payment)
    photographed using a mobile device or computer. This functionality is
    limited to those forms or items that the Services can read. If the form or
    other item you photograph and submit through the Services is not supported
    or is otherwise unreadable, you agree to manually enter your data. (c)   You may be offered the ability to import data from other sources in
    addition to those above. You may provide us with your authorization and
    information to allow us to obtain your data from third parties on your
    behalf to use the Services or any third-party service that you select. You
    represent that you have the necessary rights to grant us permission to
    access your accounts with third parties. Third parties are not affiliated
    with or endorsed or sponsored by us. 2.5 TurboTax Live Assisted. You may choose to purchase the TurboTax Live
    Assisted version of the Services (including QuickBooks Live Assisted Tax
    services powered by TurboTax), wherein an Intuit tax expert and/or
    outsourced tax preparer (together, “Expert(s)”) will assist with preparation
    of your federal and/or state tax return(s) and/or help prepare your return
    with your active participation and answer certain questions you may have
    about your tax return. The Intuit TurboTax Verified Pro tax preparation and
    filing services are not part of these Services and are governed by a
    separate agreement. If you choose to use TurboTax Live Assisted versions of
    the Services, the following additional terms and conditions will apply: (a) Some tax topics or situations may not be included as part of the
    Service, which shall be determined in Intuit’s sole discretion. The tax
    assistance provided to you by the Expert will be based on information you
    provide. You understand and agree that if you provide incorrect or
    incomplete information, the assistance provided to you may not be accurate.
    You agree you are responsible for the overall accuracy of the data in your
    final tax return(s). (b) If you request a review of your tax return or if the assistance with
    your tax return requires significant oversight and actual preparation, or
    you choose to use the TurboTax Full Service product, an Expert may be
    obligated under IRS rules to sign your return as the preparer and will then
    have primary responsibility for the preparation of your return. You are
    still responsible for the information you provide, for providing all
    necessary information and documents and for reviewing your return before it
    is filed to verify its overall completeness and accuracy. You also
    understand and agree that once you delegate preparation of your tax return
    to the Expert, you will no longer be able to prepare your tax return
    yourself using the Services. You will be required to timely provide your
    Expert with access to all necessary supporting tax documentation (for
    example, W-2s, 1099s, business financial documents, etc.) as may be
    requested by the Expert, as well as to provide or enter any other necessary
    information at your Expert’s request. (c) Tax returns prepared by or with the assistance of an Expert shall be
    subject to the following additional terms and conditions: No Tax Planning. Unless otherwise specified explicitly, the Services
            do not include tax planning services. Your Expert may provide
            suggestions or guidance or recommend tax savings strategies, however
            it is up to you to decide whether to follow such suggestions, and it
            is your sole decision and responsibility whether to act on any
            recommended actions. Where applicable, we may recommend estimated
            quarterly tax payment amounts based on your current year tax return
            and information you provide about future income. You are responsible
            for deciding whether and how to make such payments and for adjusting
            such payments if your financial situation changes. Not All Tax Situations Included. Intuit, in its sole discretion and
            at any time, may determine that certain tax topics, forms and/or
            situations are not included as part of the Services and may decline
            to provide such Services. See Section 14 for some business types
            that are excluded from TurboTax Live business offerings. No Legal Advice. The Services do not provide or include any legal or
            investment advice, tax, estate or investment planning, or other
            areas of advice other than the federal and state income tax
            preparation and filing advice included with the Services. Your Expert. Your engagement with your assigned Expert will conclude
            with either: (a) your Expert notifying you that your tax returns are
            ready to file within TurboTax Online; (b) your Expert notifying you
            that additional information is needed but you fail to respond in a
            timely way to such requests; (c) your e-filed tax returns being sent
            and accepted by the taxing authority; or (d) delivery of electronic
            copies of completed tax returns to you for paper filing (if you are
            paper filing by mail). Intuit may from time to time, in its sole
            discretion, need to assign another Expert to assist with your
            return(s) due to expertise, volume, availability or other
            circumstances. More than one Expert or other Intuit employee,
            assistant or contractor may work with your Expert to assist with
            collecting and reviewing your documents and other information,

        otherwise verify the information you submit ,although we may ask you for clarification of some of the information. Record Keeping. You are responsible for maintaining adequate

            applicable law and regulation. You agree to hold Intuit harmless

            accuracy of the data in your final tax return(s). We will not file
            any tax returns until we receive your payment for the Services and
            your consent to e-file/submit your tax return(s). Your Expert will
            notify you when your tax return(s) is/are ready to file, and Intuit
            may charge you for the Services at that time, regardless of whether
            you decide to proceed with filing. After payment, you will need to
            download and carefully review an electronic copy of your completed
            tax return(s) for accuracy and completeness. If you identify any
            errors in your tax return during your review (and before you
            approve), you agree to promptly notify your Expert and work with the
            Expert to correct the errors. To approve your personal individual

            printed and mailed returns. These forms may use a third party
            e-signature provider which you agree to use. You agree that with
            your electronic signature on these forms you represent that you and
            any joint filer have received a copy of, reviewed and approved the

            process and you agree to do so. Electronic Filing. Electronic filing may not be available for
            certain tax returns or in some states. Intuit’s responsibility with
            respect to e-filing your tax return(s) is limited to using
            commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate the transmission of
            your tax return(s) to the applicable taxing authority who accepts
            them. If we cannot electronically transmit your tax return, you
            agree to manually print and sign the tax return and mail the tax

            manner. You will be responsible for postage and mailing of such tax
            return(s). When paper tax returns are used, the TurboTax Live

            filing-by-mail instructions) are provided to you. Joint Filers. You agree that for returns with “married filing
            jointly” filing status, both spouses are deemed to be customers of

            acknowledge that there is no expectation of privacy between the
            spouses by Intuit concerning the Services in connection with this
            Agreement. We shall be at liberty to share with either of you,
            without prior consent of the other, partial or completed tax
            returns, tax documents and other information concerning the
            preparation of your tax return(s). Specific Tax Situations. We will use reasonable judgment to resolve
            questions where a tax law may be unclear, to the extent permitted by
            professional conduct and applicable law and provided there is
            substantial authority for doing so. You may request a specific
            position, provided it is consistent with our understanding of the
            Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”), tax regulations, Revenue Rulings,
            Revenue Procedures, Private Letter Rulings and any related court
            cases or laws. For tax returns where the Expert is the preparer, if
            we disagree with the position you request, we may decline to prepare
            and sign your return, and you may cease use of the Services and
            complete your tax return(s) yourself using a method or service other
            than TurboTax Live Assisted. Foreign Account Reporting. The U.S. imposes reporting requirements

            to comply with these reporting requirements may result in
            substantial civil and criminal penalties. You are responsible for
            informing us of all foreign assets, and we may determine that you

            associated with the failure to file, or untimely filing, of any of
            these forms. Intuit may provide you with the option to file your

    conditions will apply: a. Service Description. Full Service is available for preparation of federal and/or state
            individual and certain types of business income tax return(s) for

            estate, business (except as provided in Section 2.6(a)(iii)), local
            or sales tax returns. You are solely responsible for determining any
            other tax filing obligations you may have with the respective taxing

            provide suggestions or guidance or recommend tax savings strategies,
            however it is up to you to decide whether to follow such
            suggestions, and it is your sole decision and responsibility whether
            to act on any recommended actions. Where applicable, we may
            recommend estimated quarterly tax payment amounts based on your
            current year tax return and information you provide about future
            income. You are responsible for deciding whether and how to make
            such payments and for adjusting such payments if your financial
            situation changes. Intuit, in its sole discretion and at any time, may determine that
            certain tax topics, forms, business types and/or situations are not

            appropriately reconciled at their discretion and has the right to
            refuse to start preparation of the return until any necessary
            bookkeeping is complete. Intuit may, at its sole discretion, provide
            you a referral to a fee-based bookkeeping or books clean-up option
            via Intuit QuickBooks Live services, but it is not required that you
            choose an Intuit product to get your bookkeeping records ready for
            tax preparation usage. b. Your Expert. Your engagement with your assigned Expert will conclude with
    either: (a) your Expert notifying you that your tax returns are ready to

    information is needed but you then fail to respond in a timely way to such
    requests; (c) your e-filed tax returns being sent and accepted by the taxing
    authority; or (d) delivery of electronic copies of completed tax returns to
    you for paper filing (if you are paper filing by mail). Intuit may from time
    to time, in its sole discretion, need to assign another Expert to complete
    your tax return due to expertise, volume, availability or other
    circumstances. More than one Expert or other Intuit employee, assistant or
    contractor may work with your Expert to assist with collecting and reviewing
    your documents and other information, entering data, scheduling any contact
    with you and/or reviewing your tax return for accuracy.  Intuit and/or its

    within a reasonable amount of time. c. Information You Provide: We will prepare your tax returns solely based on the information you
            have provided. You will provide this information by uploading

            have provided prior consent. You may not record such video calls
            without written consent of the Expert. Your Expert may choose to end
            the call at any time if they believe your conduct violates these
            Terms. It is your responsibility to promptly provide all information that we
        require for the preparation of complete and accurate tax returns. You
        represent that all information you provide is true and accurate and that you
        have the right to share the information with Intuit and you understand that
        you are solely responsible for the completeness and overall accuracy of the
        data in your final tax return. We have the right, in our sole discretion, to cancel your Full
            Service version of the Services if you fail to provide requested
            information or do not respond to the Expert’s requests in a timely
            manner. If you provide any of your information within less than 10
            days of the tax filing deadline, we may ask you to file an
            extension. If you decline to file an extension, we have the right to
            decline to provide TurboTax Live Full Service to you. Through Full Service, the preparation of tax returns cannot be
            relied upon to discover errors, fraud or other irregularities in
            prior year tax returns or other documents, should any exist. We will
            not independently audit or otherwise verify the information you
            submit , although we may ask you for clarification of some of the
            information. d. Record Keeping. You are responsible for maintaining adequate
    documentation to substantiate the accuracy and completeness of your tax
    returns. While Intuit will store certain tax records in accordance with IRS

    extent required by applicable law and regulation. You agree to hold Intuit
    harmless from any liability resulting from or due to audit and/or inadequate
    documentation, including but not limited to additional tax, penalties,
    interest and professional fees, requirement to file an amended return, or
    the disallowance of tax deductions. e. Approval of Final Tax Returns. You are responsible for the overall
    accuracy of the data in your final tax return(s). We will not file any tax
    returns until we receive your payment for the Services and your consent to
    e-file/submit your tax return(s). Your Expert will notify you when your tax
    return is ready to file, and Intuit may charge you for the Services at that
    time, regardless of whether you decide to proceed with filing. After
    payment, you will need to download and carefully review an electronic copy
    of your completed tax return(s) for accuracy and completeness. If you
    identify any errors in your tax return during your review (and before you
    approve), you agree to promptly notify your Expert and work with the Expert
    to correct the errors. To approve your return, you will electronically sign
    a completed Form 8879, IRS e-file Signature Authorization and any additional
    applicable state and local authorization forms required to allow Intuit to
    electronically file your tax return(s). These forms may use a third party
    e-signature provider which you agree to use. You agree that with your
    electronic signature on these forms you represent that you and any joint
    filer have received a copy of, reviewed and approved the final tax return(s)
    as complete and accurate. You and any joint filer or spouse also agree that,
    in the case of a jointly-filed return, you and such joint filer or spouse
    must both sign Form 8879 to complete the approval process. To approve your
    business tax return, you will electronically sign a completed Form 8453-S or
    8453-PE, IRS e-file Signature Authorization, and any additional applicable
    state and local authorization forms required to allow Intuit to file your
    tax return(s). These forms may use a third party e-signature provider which
    you agree to use. You agree that with your electronic signature on these
    forms, you represent that you are the designated tax partnership
    representative or corporate officer with authority to file such return(s),
    and that you have received a copy of, reviewed, and approved the final tax
    return(s) as complete and accurate. You, as the designated representative or
    corporate officer, must sign Form 8453-PE or 8453-S to complete the approval
    process and you agree to do so. f. Electronic Filing. Electronic filing may not be available for certain tax
    returns or in some states. Intuit’s responsibility with respect to e-filing
    your tax return(s) is limited to using commercially reasonable efforts to
    facilitate the transmission of your tax return(s) to the applicable taxing
    authority who accepts them. If we cannot electronically transmit your tax
    return, you agree to manually print and sign the tax return and mail the tax
    return directly to the respective taxing authority in a timely manner. You
    will be responsible for postage and mailing of such tax return(s). When
    paper tax returns are used, the Services shall be considered completed when

    of your tax return(s). h. Specific Tax Situations. We will use reasonable judgment to resolve
    questions where a tax law may be unclear, to the extent permitted by

    Rulings, Revenue Procedures, Private Letter Rulings and any related court
    cases or laws. For TurboTax Full Service, where the Expert is the preparer,
    if we disagree with the position you request, we may decline to prepare and
    sign your return and you may cease use of the Services and complete your
    return(s) yourself using a method or service other than TurboTax Live Full
    Service. i. Foreign Account Reporting. The U.S. imposes reporting requirements with
    respect to persons having certain direct and indirect interests in a foreign
    bank account or other foreign financial assets. Failure to comply with these
    reporting requirements may result in substantial civil and criminal
    penalties. You are responsible for informing us of all foreign assets and we
    may determine that you are not eligible for TurboTax Live Full Service based
    on your situation with such foreign assets. If we prepare your individual
    income tax return, you will be responsible for filing any required foreign
    tax returns or required foreign account reporting, including FBAR (FinCEN
    Form 114). You, and not Intuit, assume all liability for any penalties
    associated with the failure to file, or untimely filing, of any of these
    forms. Intuit may provide you with the option to file your FBAR (FinCEN Form
    114) as set forth in Section 2.7, Non-Tax Preparation Services, below. You
    understand and agree that your use of such services will be governed by
    Section 2.7 below and will not be considered a tax preparation service. j. Change or Termination of Services. Intuit reserves the right to refuse to
    prepare a tax return for any reason in its sole discretion. Additionally,
    the availability of TurboTax Live Full Service Experts or their ability to
    meet your tax filing deadlines is subject to availability, reasonable timing
    allowed, prompt submission and presentation of documents and your prompt
    response to inquiries or requests for materials required for your tax
    return(s).  Intuit reserves the right to revoke a delegated tax return for
    any reason in its sole discretion. TurboTax Live Full Service for tax

    consultations), Intuit provides certain Services that do not involve
    preparation of a tax return, including education, trackers, and organizers
    to help with year-round tax help and organization. These Services may be
    made available on or through the TurboTax website or application or other
    sites, including third-party sites, and their availability to you may depend
    on whether you use certain other Intuit or TurboTax products. These features
    and their availability and pricing are subject to change without notice. You
    understand and agree that the TurboTax Non-Tax Preparation Services are
    intended for general information, organizational and non-tax-related
    purposes. These Services are not, and should not be construed as, legal,
    investment, credit repair, debt management, tax/retirement planning, or
    financial advice and they are not intended to serve as tax preparation
    services. When you are ready to prepare a state or federal tax return, you
    can use other services, including other TurboTax Services, to prepare and
    file your return. If you choose to use TurboTax tax preparation Services,
    certain of the TurboTax Non-Tax Preparation Services may offer you the
    ability to import and/or upload certain information to the tax preparation
    Services for use in preparing your return, including information from your
    Intuit Account and/or from third parties. If you choose to do so, you are
    responsible for verifying the accuracy of any such information. As a user of
    the TurboTax Non-Tax Preparation Services, you are granted a limited license
    to use the TurboTax Non-Tax Preparation Services solely for your own
    personal use. You understand and agree that Intuit may discontinue these
    TurboTax Non-Tax Preparation Services at any time without notice, that the
    TurboTax Non-Tax Preparation Services are provided on a strictly “as-is”
    basis, with no warranties or guarantees. (a) FBAR (Form FinCEN 114) Filing Service : You understand that Intuit may
    provide you with a self-service FBAR filing solution (“FBAR Service”) that
    enables you to prepare and file the FBAR (Form FinCEN 114) with the
    Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FINCEN). You agree that you are solely
    responsible for the accuracy of the data you enter into the FBAR Service,
    that Intuit is not responsible for verifying the accuracy of the data you
    enter, and that Intuit will not attempt to verify such accuracy. You also
    agree that you are solely responsible for complying with all laws,
    regulations, and instructions regarding the FBAR filing, including record
    keeping requirements of each account reported. Intuit may provide you the
    ability to print a copy of the information you enter to file the FBAR Form,
    but you understand and agree that Intuit will only provide unformatted data
    to you upon request, and may not provide an exact copy of the FBAR that gets
    filed with FINCEN. You further understand that failure to comply with the
    FBAR filing requirements, including submission of late, incomplete,
    inaccurate or fraudulent FBARs, may result in penalties and/or criminal
    liability. You agree and acknowledge that Intuit is and shall not be liable
    for any such penalties or legal consequences resulting from your use of the
    FBAR Service, and that you are solely responsible for confirming successful
    filing with the relevant authority. 3. HELP AND SUPPORT Intuit may use a variety of methods (e.g., in-product, widgets, Internet,
    remote access, online community, chat, e-mail, video and phone) to provide
    technical support and customer service in connection with the Services. The
    terms and conditions governing the offering of this support, which may
    require the payment of an additional fee, are subject to change as announced
    by Intuit from time to time. If you choose to allow an Intuit agent to have
    remote access to your computer via the Internet to provide help, you should
    close other browsers or applications or follow other instructions to enable
    such access. Consult the TurboTax Online Help and Support website for the
    most up-to-date information relating to this support and any associated
    charges. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Services are not
    accessible after October 15 of each calendar year after the applicable tax
    year of your return(s) and shall not be supported beyond that date. 4. GUARANTEES (a) TurboTax Accurate Calculation Guarantee – Individual Returns. Intuit
    works to ensure the accuracy of the calculations on every form prepared
    using the Services. The TurboTax Accurate Calculation Guarantee is for the
    lifetime of your 2023 individual tax return, which Intuit defines as seven
    (7) years from the date you filed it using TurboTax Online. The Guarantee
    applies only to individual returns filed using TurboTax (excluding business
    returns), and only if filed with the IRS or, in the case of state returns,
    the relevant state tax authority, all subject to the terms below: If you are a registered user and you pay an IRS or state penalty
            and/or interest as levied in a first notice from a tax authority
            (and not as a result of a payment plan), and such IRS or state
            penalty and/or interest is due solely to a calculation error on a
            form prepared and filed using TurboTax Online, and not as a result
            of, among other things: your failure to enter all required information accurately, willful or fraudulent omission or inclusion of information on your
            tax return, misclassification of information on the tax return, tax law changes made by federal or state governments after your
            return was filed, or failure to file an amended return to avoid or reduce an applicable
            penalty/interest after Intuit announced updates or corrections to
            the TurboTax Online software in time for you to file an amended
            return, then Intuit will reimburse the amount actually paid by you to the IRS or
    state in penalties and/or interest as levied against you in such first
    notice – but not any amounts, penalties or interest due, payable or paid by
    you as a result of a payment plan you may enter into (or have entered into)
    with such tax authority. This Accurate Calculation Guarantee does not apply to tax forms
            completed manually by you in which the data is entered directly by
            you into the form itself in TurboTax, rather than through the use of
            the in-product TurboTax interview experience and guidance. You are responsible for paying any additional tax liability you may
            owe and for providing any other information Intuit reasonably
            requests to validate your claim. A "registered user" is a user from
            whom Intuit has received the information necessary to permit such
            person, or an assigned TurboTax expert in the case of TurboTax Live
            Full Service, to print or electronically file an individual tax
            return prepared using the TurboTax Online Services and who complies
            with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If you believe such a calculation error occurred, you must notify
            Intuit as soon as you learn of the mistake and in any case (a) no
            later than thirty (30) days after the penalty or interest is
            assessed by a tax authority, and (b) no later than seven (7) years
            after the return was filed, which Intuit defines as the lifetime of
            the tax return. To initiate a claim under this Guarantee, please contact Intuit
            using the instructions set forth on our website, as currently
            published at: https://ttlc.intuit.com/turbotax-support/en-us/help-article/intuit-account-billing/submit-claim-turbotax-100-accurate-calculation-100/L88SYklBL_US_en_US?uid=ldaqp1ft . You will be required to provide all tax-related documents, and any
            other relevant documents or information we reasonably request,
            either electronically or by First-Class U.S. mail with USPS Tracking
            (to ensure tracked delivery), to enable Intuit to validate and
            process your claim. To validate a claim, Intuit may require, among
            other information, your TurboTax tax data file (particularly if you
            did not electronically file), a copy of the IRS/state notice and any
            other documents to support proof of income, credits or deductions.
            You are responsible for maintaining all information and documents
            that may be relevant to the accuracy of your tax return. In this
            regard, you are responsible for keeping Intuit apprised promptly of
            any change in your email address, mailing address and/or phone
            number so that you can be notified of such updates or corrections.
            This guarantee does not apply to business returns. (b) TurboTax Maximum Refund Guarantee – Individual Returns. The TurboTax
    Maximum Refund (Tax Savings) Guarantee is for the lifetime of your 2023
    individual tax return, which Intuit defines as seven (7) years from the date
    you filed it using TurboTax Online. The Guarantee applies only to individual
    returns filed using TurboTax (excluding business returns), and only if filed
    with the IRS or, in the case of state returns, the relevant state tax
    authority, all subject to the terms below: If you are a registered user of TurboTax and use TurboTax for
            preparation and filing of your 2023 individual return, and later
            file an amended return using identical information and data but
            using a tax preparation method other than TurboTax, and you receive
            a larger refund amount or pay a smaller tax due amount using such
            alternative method (excluding where any tax law changes made by
            federal or state governments after your original TurboTax-based
            return was filed cause a change in refund or tax due), then Intuit
            will refund to you the applicable purchase price actually paid by
            you for the preparation and filing of your 2023 federal and/or state
            individual return using TurboTax Services. TurboTax Free Edition
            customers are entitled to payment of $30 in such case. To qualify,
            the larger refund or smaller tax due cannot be attributed to
            variations in the information or data you used for such alternate
            tax preparation method or for positions taken by you or your
            alternate preparer or method that are contrary to the law, or to
            changes in tax law that occurred after you filed your return using
            TurboTax. Claims must be submitted within sixty (60) days of the date you
            receive a larger refund amount or pay a smaller tax due amount and
            no later than seven (7) years after the return was filed, which
            Intuit defines as the lifetime of the tax return. To submit a claim, you must provide Intuit with the following
            documents via first-class U.S. mail and add USPS Tracking to your
            shipment to ensure tracked delivery: copy of your TurboTax proof of payment (i.e., sales receipt)
                and/or shipment packing slip, copy of your proof of payment for another tax preparation method
                (unless done manually by you), copy of your TurboTax data file and return, copy of the printed and filed tax return from the other tax
                preparation method; and a letter summarizing your refund or tax due amount using
                TurboTax and your refund or tax due amount using another tax preparation method. You must send all of the foregoing by mail to TurboTax Maximum
                Refund Guarantee, 2800 E Commerce Center Place, Tucson, AZ
                85726-8867. You must maintain separate copies of all submitted
                items for your records. Claims of non-payment of a refund of
                your TurboTax purchase price will require photocopy
                substantiation of all required items. Please allow up to 6 weeks
                for processing and delivery. If after 8 weeks you have not
                received your check, contact us via the TurboTax support
                website. Any materials submitted to Intuit are understood to be
                non-returnable. You are responsible for maintaining all
                documents necessary to qualify for the Guarantee. All other fees you may have paid to Intuit for additional services
            or as add-ons to your Tax Year 2023 return are excluded from this
            money-back guarantee, including but not limited to electronic filing
            fees, Audit Defense, Refund Processing Service and technical support
            fees, if any. This guarantee cannot be combined with the
            Satisfaction Guarantee below. This guarantee does not apply to business returns. (c) TurboTax Audit Support Guarantee – Individual Returns. The Audit Support Guarantee is for the lifetime of your 2023 individual tax
    return filed with TurboTax, which Intuit defines as seven (7) years from the
    date you filed it using TurboTax Online. The Guarantee applies only to
    individual returns filed using TurboTax (excluding business returns), and
    only if filed with the IRS or, in the case of state returns, the relevant
    state tax authority, all subject to the terms below: If you are a registered user of TurboTax, use TurboTax for
            preparation and filing of your individual return(s), and receive an
            audit letter from the IRS or State Department of Revenue relating to
            your 2023 TurboTax-filed individual return, then Intuit will provide

            Guarantee is applicable to Federal and State audit letters and/or

            TurboTax individual federal and/or state tax return preparation and
            filing under this Agreement. TurboTax Federal Free Edition customers
            are entitled to payment of $30. Any other fees you may have paid to
            Intuit for additional services or as add-ons to your Tax Year 2023
            return are excluded from this guarantee, including but not limited

            your claim that we were unable to connect you with a tax
            professional for audit guidance, and as a precondition of refund
            payment, Intuit may require your TurboTax data file for the
            applicable tax year and/or other supporting information such as
            copies of your printed tax returns. Any materials submitted to
            Intuit are understood to be non-returnable. You are responsible for
            maintaining all documents necessary to qualify for the guarantee. This guarantee does not apply to business returns and cannot be
            combined with the Satisfaction Guarantee below. (d) TurboTax Satisfaction Guaranteed (or Guaranteed Easy). Some versions of
    the Services allow you to use the TurboTax Services without charge up to the
    point you decide to print or electronically file your tax return. You
    understand and agree that printing or electronically filing your return
    reflects (a) your satisfaction with Services and (b) your acknowledgement
    and understanding that you are, at the time of printing or filing,
    voluntarily paying for the Services, and you therefore waive the right to
    receive a refund. (e) TurboTax Accurate Calculation Guarantee – Business Tax Returns. Intuit
    works to ensure the accuracy of the calculations on every form prepared
    using the TurboTax Live Business Assisted and TurboTax Live Full Service
    Business versions of the Services. If you are a registered user of our TurboTax Live Business Assisted or
    TurboTax Live Full Service Business versions of the Services and you pay an
    IRS or state penalty and/or interest, as levied in a first notice from a tax
    authority, solely because of a calculation error on a form prepared using
    such versions of the Services, and not as a result of, among other things: your failure to enter all required information accurately, willful or fraudulent omission or inclusion of information on your
            tax return, misclassification of information on the tax return, tax law changes made by federal or state governments after your
            return was filed, or failure to file an amended return to avoid or reduce an applicable
            penalty/interest after Intuit announced updates or corrections to
            the TurboTax Live Business Assisted or TurboTax Live Full Service
            Business versions of the Services in time for you to file an amended
            return, then Intuit will pay you in the amount of the IRS or state penalty and/or
    interest paid by you to the IRS or state. In this regard, you are
    responsible for keeping Intuit apprised promptly of any change in your email
    address, mailing address and/or phone number so that you can be notified of
    such updates or corrections. This business version of the Accurate Calculation Guarantee does not apply
    to tax forms completed manually by you in which the data is entered directly
    by you into the form itself in TurboTax, rather than through the use of the
    in-product TurboTax interview experience and Expert guidance and/or entry of
    information by the Expert. You are responsible for paying any additional tax liability you may owe and
    providing any other information Intuit reasonably requests to validate your
    claim. A "registered user" for purposes of this Guarantee is a user from
    whom Intuit has received the information necessary to permit such person or
    Intuit’s Expert to print or electronically file a tax return prepared using
    the TurboTax Live Business Assisted or TurboTax Live Full Service Business
    versions of the Services and who complies with the terms and conditions of
    this Agreement. If you believe such a calculation error occurred, you must notify Intuit as
    soon as you learn of the alleged error, and in no event later than: (a)
    thirty (30) days after the penalty or interest is assessed; and (b) seven
    years from the date the business return was first filed. Send by mail to
    TurboTax Live Business Assisted and TurboTax Live Full Service Business
    Accurate Calculation Guarantee, 2800 E Commerce Center Place, Tucson, AZ
    85726-8867. Intuit will then contact you promptly to resolve the issue. To
    validate the claim, Intuit may require a copy of your tax return as
    originally filed and other related documents (particularly if you did not

            version of the Services you purchased under this Agreement. Any
            other fees you may have paid to Intuit for additional services or as
            add-ons to your Tax Year 2023 business tax return are excluded,
            including but not limited to electronic filing fees, Audit Defense,

            connect you with a tax professional for audit guidance, and as a
            precondition of refund payment, Intuit may require your TurboTax
            data file for the applicable tax year and/or other supporting
            information such as copies of your printed tax returns. Any
            materials submitted to Intuit are understood to be non-returnable.
            You are responsible for maintaining all documents necessary to
            qualify for the guarantee. This Guarantee cannot be combined with the Satisfaction Guarantee
            above. (g) TurboTax 100% Accurate, Expert Approved Guarantee – TurboTax Live
    Assisted and TurboTax Live Full Service Only. The following guarantee shall apply only to returns filed with the IRS or
    states using TurboTax Live Assisted and TurboTax Live Full Service
    offerings, all subject to the terms below: If you are a registered user of TurboTax Live Assisted or TurboTax
            Live Full Service and you pay an IRS or state penalty and/or
            interest as levied in a first notice from a tax authority (and not
            as a result of a payment plan), and such IRS or state penalty and/or
            interest is due solely to an error the Expert made while preparing
            your return, providing topic-specific tax advice, a section review
            or on a form signed by the Expert and not as a result of, among
            other things: your failure to provide all required information and do so
            accurately, willful or fraudulent omission or inclusion of information for your
            tax return, or misrepresentation of your tax information, tax law changes made by federal or state governments after your
            return was filed, failure to file your tax return on time or to take other action
            requested by the Expert, or failure to file an amended return to avoid or reduce an applicable
            penalty/interest after Intuit informed you of updates or corrections
            in time for you to file an amended return, then Intuit will reimburse the amount actually paid by you to the IRS or
    state in penalties and/or interest as levied against you in such first
    notice – but not any amounts, penalties, or interest due, payable or paid by
    you as a result of a payment plan you may enter into (or have entered into)
    with such tax authority. You are responsible for paying any additional tax liability you may
            owe and for providing any other information Intuit reasonably
            requests to validate your claim. A "registered user" is a user of
            TurboTax Live Assisted or TurboTax Live Full Service from whom
            Intuit has received the information necessary to permit such person,
            or an assigned TurboTax expert in the case of TurboTax Live Full
            Service, to print or electronically file a tax return prepared using
            the TurboTax Online Services and who complies with the terms and
            conditions of this Agreement. If you believe such an error occurred, you must notify Intuit as
            soon as you learn of the mistake and in no event later than (a)
            thirty (30) days after the penalty or interest is assessed; and (b)
            no later than seven (7) years after the return was filed, which
            Intuit defines as the lifetime of the tax return. To initiate a claim under this Guarantee, please contact Intuit
            using the instructions set forth on our website, as currently
            published at: https://ttlc.intuit.com/turbotax-support/en-us/help-article/intuit-account-billing/submit-claim-turbotax-100-accurate-calculation-100/L88SYklBL_US_en_US?uid=ldaqp1ft . You will be required to provide all tax-related documents, and any
            other relevant documents or information we reasonably request,
            either electronically or by First-Class U.S. mail with USPS Tracking
            (to ensure tracked delivery), to enable Intuit to validate and
            process your claim. To validate a claim Intuit may require, among
            other documents, a copy of your tax return (particularly if you did
            not electronically file), a copy of the IRS/state notice and any
            other documents to support proof of income, credits or deductions.
            You are responsible for maintaining all information and documents
            that may be relevant to the accuracy of your tax return. In this
            regard, you are responsible for keeping Intuit apprised promptly of
            any change in your email address, mailing address and/or phone
            number so that you can be notified of such updates or corrections. This Guarantee cannot be combined with the TurboTax Accurate
            Calculation Guarantee or the TurboTax Satisfaction Guarantee above. h. TurboTax Live Full Service Guarantee - Individual and Business. If you
    use TurboTax Live Full Service (Individual or Business; Full Service only,
    not Assisted), your tax expert will only sign and file your return if they
    believe it is 100% correct based on the information you provide and that you
    are getting your best outcome possible. If you get a larger refund or
    smaller tax due by filing an amended return with another tax preparer, we'll
    refund the applicable federal and/or state purchase price you paid.
    Additionally, if you pay an IRS or state penalty or interest because of an
    error that a TurboTax Full Service Expert made while acting as the paid
    preparer for your return, we'll pay you the penalty and interest as set out
    below. If you are a registered user of TurboTax Live Full Service and you pay an
    IRS or state penalty and/or interest as levied in a first notice from a tax
    authority (and not as a result of a payment plan), and such IRS or state
    penalty and/or interest is due solely to an error the Expert made while
    preparing your return, providing topic-specific tax advice, a section review
    or on a form signed by the Expert and not as a result of, among other
    things: your failure to provide all required information and do so
            accurately, willful or fraudulent omission or inclusion of information for your
            tax return, or misrepresentation of your tax information, tax law changes made by federal or state governments after your
            return was filed, failure to file your tax return on time or to take other action
            requested by the Expert, or failure to file an amended return to avoid or reduce an applicable
            penalty/interest after Intuit informed you of updates or corrections
            in time for you to file an amended return, then Intuit will reimburse the amount actually paid by you to the IRS or
    state in penalties and/or interest as levied against you in such first
    notice – but not any amounts, penalties, or interest due, payable or paid by
    you as a result of a payment plan you may enter into (or have entered into)
    with such tax authority. You are responsible for paying any additional tax liability you may owe and
    for providing any other information Intuit reasonably requests to validate
    your claim. A "registered user" is a user of TurboTax Live Full Service from
    whom Intuit has received the information necessary to permit an assigned
    TurboTax Expert to prepare, sign on behalf of the taxpayer, and
    electronically file a tax return prepared using the TurboTax Full Service,
    and which registered user complies with the terms and conditions of this
    Agreement. If you believe such an error occurred, you must notify Intuit as soon as you
    learn of the mistake and in no event later than (a) thirty (30) days after
    the penalty or interest is assessed; and (b) no later than seven (7) years
    after the return was filed, which Intuit defines as the lifetime of the tax
    return. To initiate a claim under this Guarantee, please contact Intuit using the
    instructions set forth on our website, as currently published at: https://ttlc.intuit.com/turbotax-support/en-us/help-article/intuit-account-billing/submit-claim-turbotax-100-accurate-calculation-100/L88SYklBL_US_en_US?uid=ldaqp1ft .
     You will be required to provide all tax-related documents, and any other
    relevant documents or information we reasonably request, either
    electronically or by First-Class U.S. mail with USPS Tracking (to ensure
    tracked delivery), to enable Intuit to validate and process your claim. To
    validate a claim Intuit may require, among other documents, a copy of your
    tax return (particularly if you did not electronically file), a copy of the
    IRS/state notice and any other documents to support proof of income, credits
    or deductions. You are responsible for maintaining all information and
    documents that may be relevant to the accuracy of your tax return. In this
    regard, you are responsible for keeping Intuit apprised promptly of any
    change in your email address, mailing address and/or phone number so that
    you can be notified of such updates or corrections. This Guarantee cannot be combined with the TurboTax Accurate Calculation
    Guarantee, the TurboTax Satisfaction Guarantee or the TurboTax 100%
    Accurate, Expert Approved Guarantee. 5. THIRD PARTY SERVICES To facilitate Third Party Services, Intuit may be required to obtain your
    explicit consent for disclosure and/or use of your information. By accepting
    these Third Party Services agreements and consents, you authorize Intuit to
    use and disclose your information, including name and address, to the third
    party for the purpose of making the Third Party Services you choose
    available to you. For some Third Party Services, we may submit an
    application on your behalf using your information to assist you in obtaining
    a benefit provided by a third party. You acknowledge that Intuit does not
    determine if you receive the benefit and that you are solely responsible for
    meeting the third party’s requirements and complying with applicable laws
    and regulations. You may need to provide us with your account number,
    password, security questions and answers and other necessary login
    information (“Login Details”). You hereby represent that you have the
    authority to provide the Login Details to Intuit, and you expressly appoint
    Intuit as your, or the third party who owns the Login Details, agent with
    limited power of attorney to access any Third Party Services on your behalf.
    You must provide true and accurate information. A third party’s terms and
    conditions are generally found on the third party’s website. However, the
    applicable terms and conditions for the audit defense memberships are
    accessible on the TurboTax website. Your participation in Third Party
    Services indicates your acceptance of such terms and conditions for such
    Third Party Services. If you sign up for a Third Party Service that requires
    access to your information on an ongoing basis and you subsequently want us
    to stop making your information available to such third party, you should
    discontinue use of the Third Party Services. If you sign up for the Refund Processing Service, which enables you to
    deduct certain refund processing fees and any applicable tax from the
    proceeds of your federal and/or state tax refund(s), you authorize Intuit
    (and a third party processor using banking services of a financial
    institution) to debit these amounts from your federal and/or state tax
    refunds, or from the bank account you identify as your Direct Deposit Bank
    Account in the event that you do not receive a tax refund that is sufficient
    to pay for them or in the event that your tax refund is delayed. Note that
    the Refund Processing Service fee is payable to the financial institution
    whether or not your refund is large enough to cover your TurboTax fees. You
    should evaluate all Third Party Services based on your own assessment and
    review of their terms and conditions. 6. User ID and Password Security You are the only person authorized to use your user ID and password and are
    responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your user ID and
    password. You shall not permit or allow other persons to have access to or
    use your user ID and password. You are responsible for the use of the
    Services under your user ID. If you have not electronically filed or printed
    your tax return, you must create a user ID and password in order for you to
    access your tax return data at a later date. You must remember your user ID
    and password to electronically transfer your tax return information into
    next year's tax return. If you do not complete your Tax Year 2023 return
    prior to October 15, 2024, your tax return information will be deleted from our systems. 7. Privacy of Personal and Tax Return Information; Multi-factor
    Authentication At Intuit, we place the highest importance on respecting and protecting the
    privacy of our customers. Our most important asset is our relationship with

    the Services may require multiple sources of information about you to
    confirm your identity and help ensure the security of your personal use of
    TurboTax, often referred to as “multi-factor authentication” (“MFA”). Part
    of the MFA identity authentication and verification process may involve
    Intuit sending text message(s) containing security code(s) to your telephone
    number. You agree to receive these text message(s) from Intuit containing
    security code(s) as part of the MFA process. With MFA, you also agree and consent to us obtaining and using information
    from your mobile phone service provider, solely for the purposes of
    verifying your identity and to compare information you have provided to
    Intuit (such information may include from your mobile phone service provider
    account record: your name, address, email, customer type, customer role,
    billing type, mobile device identifiers (IMSI and IMEI) and other mobile
    phone subscriber details). You also agree that your acceptance of a Third
    Party Refund Processing Service Agreement will authorize the sharing of the
    bank account information you provide to the provider and your authorization
    to debit your bank account for fees, charges and any applicable taxes owed
    to Intuit if your tax refund is not sufficient in amount to pay for those
    fees, charges and taxes (if any). By providing a telephone number in connection with the Services, you verify
    that you are the current subscriber or owner of that number. In addition,
    you expressly agree that Intuit and its affiliates may contact you by
    telephone or text message (including through the use of artificial voices,
    prerecorded voice messages and/or autodialed calls and text messages) to the
    telephone number you provide or to any number provided to us on your behalf,
    for various purposes including verifying your identity, providing you with
    important notices regarding your account or use of the Services, fulfilling
    your requests or letting you know about promotions or Other Intuit Services
    we think we may be of interest to you. Your consent to receive automated
    calls and texts is completely voluntary, and you may opt out any time. You
    acknowledge that if you do not opt out, we may contact you even if your
    number is listed on a do-not-call list or if you cancel your account or
    terminate your relationship with us. You do not have to agree to receive
    promotional calls or texts as a condition of purchasing any goods or
    services. You understand and agree, for any text messages sent to you in connection
    with the Services, that: (a) message frequency may vary, (b) message and
    data rates may apply, and Intuit is not responsible for these charges, (c)
    you may reply HELP for information, (d) you can reply STOP to opt out at any
    time (though if you do, you agree to receive a single message confirming
    your opt-out) and (e) neither Intuit nor mobile carriers involved in the
    text messaging are liable for delayed or undelivered messages. To opt out of
    automated voice calls, you must provide us with written notice revoking your
    consent by contacting us as described in the “How to Contact Us” section of
    our Privacy Statement , and including your full name, mailing address, account number and the
    specific phone number(s) you wish to opt out of such calls. You also acknowledge and agree that your telephone calls to or from Intuit
    or its affiliates may be monitored and recorded. You must notify us
    immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your telephone.
    Although we will not be liable for losses caused by any unauthorized use of
    your telephone, you may be liable for our losses due to such unauthorized
    use. 8. USE WITH YOUR MOBILE DEVICE. 8.1 Mobile access to the Services requires a compatible mobile browser
