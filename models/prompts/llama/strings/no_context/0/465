Locations Students Engineering Open Jobs Our mission is to share and grow the world’s knowledge. The vast majority of human knowledge is still not on the internet. Most of it is trapped in the form of experience in people’s heads, or buried in books and papers that only experts can access. More than a billion people use the internet yet only a tiny fraction contribute their knowledge to it. We want to democratize access to knowledge of all kinds—from politics to painting, cooking to coding, etymology to experiences—so if someone out there knows something, anyone else can learn it. Our mission is to share and grow the world's knowledge, and we're building a world-class team to help us achieve this mission. What we are building Quora is a global knowledge sharing platform with over 400 million monthly unique visitors, connecting people to share insights on various topics and providing a unique platform to learn, share, and connect with others. Poe lets people ask questions, get instant answers, and have back-and-forth conversations with AI. Our values At Quora, every team member embodies these core values. We believe this makes us successful and work so synchronously together. Awareness We are rigorous in our decisions and candid in our communication. Drive We aim high and do whatever it takes to get things done. Agility We are nimble in our processes and systems, ready to adapt to a changing world. Pragmatism We stay grounded in the outcomes that truly matter for our mission. Mission First We place long-term, collective impact ahead of personal achievement. Why Quora? Visit our " Why Quora " page to read firsthand accounts from our employees about their experiences, what they appreciate most about our culture, and why they love working with us. Remote first All of our positions can be performed remotely and we support employment from multiple countries around the world . (For any rare exceptions that do require work from a specific location, it will be noted explicitly in the individual position's job description.) However, because we work in highly collaborative product teams, we do value synchronous coordination and need for people to be able to talk to each other in real time. We have designated 9am to 3pm Pacific Time as " coordination hours ", and most employees will be expected to be available for meetings and impromptu communication during this time, regardless of where they are located. While we are a remote company first, we recognize that working for home isn’t for everyone. To support employees in selecting the best space for their working style and productivity, we are excited to offer the Coworking Space Program. Eligible employees can now apply for reimbursement of a coworking space or for use of a private office at a WeWork paid by Quora. Employees will receive a document outlining the eligibility requirements, how to apply, and program FAQ. Note: our career page's integration with external job boards requires a location for each job posting. Please feel free to apply to any position if you are authorized to work in one of our employment eligible countries .
