A rising wedge is a reversal pattern while ascending triangle is a continuation pattern. The major difference between the two patterns is that ascending triangle has a horizontal resistance line. Both the patterns can be traded through breakout of the pattern or pullback to the broken zone. 3 hours ago 0 The Leap 338 wmlkrish: I signed in but my P/L is not being counted.
