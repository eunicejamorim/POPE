At 09:35 ET (13:35 GMT), Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 21 points, or 0.3%, while S&P 500 climbed 8 points, or 0.1% and NASDAQ Composite rose 85 points, or 0.5%. Investors have returned after the Memorial Day holiday, and volumes are set to pick up this week with a barrage of key economic readings, including the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge. PCE inflation test due this week Attention this week will focus on the release of PCE price index data on Friday, widely seen as the inflation release that the Federal Reserve concentrates on. The reading is likely to factor into the central bank’s outlook on interest rates, and will be closely watched after a string of Fed officials warned that sticky inflation will delay any plans to loosen monetary policy. This saw traders begin pricing out expectations for a rate cut in September. The CME Fedwatch tool shows traders pricing in a 50.7% probability the central bank will keep rates steady, along with a 43.6% chance of a 25 basis point rate cut. Friday’s PCE reading is expected to show some cooling in inflation. But inflation is also set to remain well above the Fed’s 2% annual target range. The economic calendar also features revised data on first quarter economic growth on Thursday and the Fed’s Beige Book on Wednesday, while investors will also get the chance to hear from several Fed speakers during the week including Governor Michelle Bowman , Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester , Governor Lisa Cook , New York Fed President John Williams and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic . 3rd party Ad.

May promises strong gains Stocks are on track to end May on a strong note, as better-than-expected quarterly earnings reports lifted sentiment, while cooler inflation data suggested rate cuts could come earlier than investors had anticipated. The S&P 500 has advanced 5.3%, the Nasdaq Composite has rallied about 8%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 3.3% , after topping 40,000 for the first time ever this month. The quarterly earnings season is gradually coming to a close, but there are still several companies on deck this week, including Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST ), Salesforce (NYSE: CRM ) and Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ: ULTA ). Elsewhere, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ) stock rose over 4%, with the tech giant’s market value surpassing $2.5 trillion since its quarterly results, solidifying its position as the third most valuable company on Wall Street. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) stock gained over 1%, after the iPhone maker’s smartphone shipments in China were 52% higher in April than a year ago, according to data from a research firm affiliated with the Chinese government. GameStop (NYSE: GME ) stock rose 15% after the video game retailer said it raked in more than $933 million from the sale of 45 million shares. On the flip side, DraftKings (NASDAQ: DKNG ) and Flutter Entertainment (NYSE: FLUT ) both traded sharply lower after the Illinois Senate passed a bill that includes a sports-betting tax hike. Crude market awaits OPEC+ meeting Crude prices edged higher, rebounding from recent losses ahead of a meeting by major producers to decide future output levels. By 09:35 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) inched up 2.1% to $79.35 a barrel, while the Brent contract traded 0.7% higher at $83.44 per barrel. 3rd party Ad.

Oil prices rose over 1% on Monday in muted trade owing to public holidays in the U.K. and the U.S., after sinking to the lowest levels since early-February last week. All eyes are now on the next meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, together called OPEC+, which is set to take place online on June 2. Much of the focus will be on whether the cartel will extend its current voluntary production cuts of 2.2 million barrels per day into the second half of the year.
