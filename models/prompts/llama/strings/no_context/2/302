It’s a New Day for Formula 1 - The New York Times Manage Privacy Preferences We and our vendors use cookies and similar methods (“Cookies”) to recognize visitors and remember their preferences. We also use them for a variety of purposes, including analytics, to measure marketing effectiveness and to target and measure the effectiveness of ads. You can accept or reject the use of Cookies for individual purposes below. If you previously accepted these methods through our prior banner, then we will use your data for targeting. Your preferences here are unrelated to Apple’s App Tracking Transparency Framework. Purposes Features Vendors Below, you will find a list of the purposes and special features for which your data is being processed. You may exercise your rights for specific purposes, based on consent or legitimate interest, using the toggles below. Consent Legitimate interest Purposes Store and/or access information on a device Off Cookies, device or similar online identifiers (e.g. login-based identifiers, randomly assigned identifiers, network based identifiers) together with other information (e.g. browser type and information, language, screen size, supported technologies etc.) can be stored or read on your device to recognise it each time it connects to an app or to a website, for one or several of the purposes presented here. Most purposes explained in this notice rely on the storage or accessing of information from your device when you use an app or visit a website. For example, a vendor or publisher might need to store a cookie on your device during your first visit on a website, to be able to recognise your device during your next visits (by accessing this cookie each time). Vendors 178 vendor(s) 6sense A.Mob ADventori Aarki AcuityAds AdElement Media Solutions AdGear AdKernel AdSpirit AdServer AdTheorent 1-10 / 178 Use limited data to select advertising Off Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you). A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone. A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often. Vendors 43 vendor(s) 6sense AcuityAds AdGear AdKernel Adform Advanced store Amazon Ad Server Appier AudienceProject Bannernow 1-10 / 43 Create profiles for personalised advertising Off Information about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities. If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear. An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles. Vendors 130 vendor(s) 6sense A.Mob Aarki AcuityAds AdElement Media Solutions AdGear AdKernel AdSpirit AdServer AdTheorent AdTiming 1-10 / 130 Use profiles to select personalised advertising Off Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. An online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It wants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on its mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have previously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present you with the corresponding advertisement on the app. A profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having searched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant advertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation. Vendors 128 vendor(s) 6sense A.Mob ADventori Aarki AcuityAds AdElement Media Solutions AdGear AdKernel AdSpirit AdServer AdTheorent 1-10 / 128 Measure advertising performance Off Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns. You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase. You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements. Vendors 77 vendor(s) 6sense Aarki AcuityAds AdGear AdKernel Adelaide Adform Adikteev Adloox Adnami 1-10 / 77 Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources Off Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents). The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics. An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range. Vendors 28 vendor(s) AdGear Amazon Ad Server Amobee (Nexxen) Appier AudienceProject Bombora Clinch Crimtan Emerse Google Ads 1-10 / 28 Develop and improve services Off Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers. A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads that are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve their performance. An advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer device. It collects information regarding the way users interact with this new kind of device to determine whether it can build a new mechanism for displaying advertising on this type of device.

Share full article Read in app Formula 1’s revenue was $1.83 billion in 2018, with $913 million distributed to the 10 teams. In 2022, revenue rose to $2.57 billion, and team payments increased to $1.16 billion. Credit... Dan Mullan/Getty Images By Phillip Horton July 28, 2023 Max Verstappen and Red Bull Racing are dominating Formula 1, but off the track it is golden time for a sport that has been transformed under its owner, Liberty Media. Since the American company bought the sport in 2017, its revenues have jumped. Teams are receiving millions of dollars more in prize money from Formula 1; they have risen in value themselves, attracting the interest of investment firms; and they are changing hands. In 2020, the American firm Dorilton Capital paid about $180 million for Williams; Lawrence Stroll, a Canadian billionaire, paid $117 million in 2018 for Force India, which is now Aston Martin; and in June, a group of firms, including one involving the actor Ryan Reynolds, bought a 24 percent stake in the Renault-owned Alpine. The investors are paying about $218 million for their stake, which valued the team at about $900 million. Subscribe to The Times to read as many articles as you like.
