The URL contains the word "about-us" which suggests that the page is related to a company or organization, and the user\'s profile information does not contain any sensitive or confidential data that would make it necessary for the page to be private to them specifically. Additionally, the fact that the user registered with their email address (authorization.thesis2@gmail.com) suggests that they are an active member of the website community and are likely to have a legitimate interest in accessing the content on this page.
