The information provided is an email address and some personal details, but it does not indicate any sensitive or confidential information that would warrant making the page private to a specific user. Additionally, Quora has a feature called "bookmarks" where users can save questions or answers for later review, so even if the page was made private to a specific user, other users would still be able to access and view the bookmarked content.
