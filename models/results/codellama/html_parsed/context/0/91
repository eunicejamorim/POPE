For example, if the user has previously searched for investing-related terms on the website, they may see relevant search results or personalized recommendations based on their previous searches. In such cases, it would be reasonable to consider the page as private to that specific user."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 36256413541, 'load_duration': 12645559, 'prompt_eval_count': 1884, 'prompt_eval_duration': 7594073000, 'eval_count': 171, 'eval_duration': 27974169000}
