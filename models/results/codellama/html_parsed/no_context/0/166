While it's possible to use the `private` flag to indicate that a particular page should only be accessible to certain users, it's generally not necessary for most websites.\n\nInstead, you can focus on making sure that your website is secure and that your content is protected from unauthorized access. This includes using secure protocols like HTTPS, implementing proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, and protecting sensitive information with encryption.\n\nAdditionally, it's important to remember that the `private` flag should only be used for pages where the data is truly sensitive or confidential, such as financial statements or other critical documents that need to be kept private.
