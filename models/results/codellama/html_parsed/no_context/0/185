The information provided in the answer is correct and helpful. However, it is crucial to remember that everyone's experience on the internet can change, and the likelihood of getting caught up in such an activity may be higher than expected. It is always important to use caution when accessing any social media platform or website.\n\nIt's important to note that the privacy settings of a user account are only as good as the password they have chosen and protected with. If the user's password has been compromised, then even if they set their privacy setting to private, an attacker could still access their account. Therefore, it is always best to use strong passwords and enable two-factor authentication to protect your online identity and personal information."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 34069965922, 'load_duration': 12265021, 'prompt_eval_count': 1736, 'prompt_eval_duration': 7233303000, 'eval_count': 167, 'eval_duration': 26107825000}
