This is because the "private" feature allows for the creation of custom groups and permissions for users, which can be beneficial in various ways. It also enables the management of data accessibility and security for each individual group, making it an important tool in organizing and managing data privacy for different users or teams.\n\nOn the other hand, the "private" feature may not always be necessary or useful for every page or application, especially if it is used to manage user information or data that needs to be shared with multiple people. In such cases, a more straightforward approach, where all users have access to the same content, can be simpler and more efficient.\n\nUltimately, whether the private feature is appropriate for a particular page depends on the specific requirements of the project or application and how the data will be used by the end-users.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 39022462500, 'load_duration': 1459068, 'prompt_eval_count': 2022, 'prompt_eval_duration': 7884647000, 'eval_count': 188, 'eval_duration': 31025040000}
