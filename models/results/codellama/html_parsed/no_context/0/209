It appears that the `private` field is set to `true` by default, which means that the page is private and only visible to the user who created it. However, if you want to make the page publicly available, you can simply remove the `private` field or change its value to `false`. Here\'s an example of how this might look:\n```html\n<div id="page-1">\n  <h2>Private Page</h2>\n  <p>This is a private page that only visible to the user who created it.</p>\n</div>\n\n<div id="page-2">\n  <h2>Public Page</h2>\n  <p>This is a public page that can be viewed by anyone.</p>\n</div>\n```\nIn this example, both pages have the same structure and content, but the `private` field is set to `true` for one of them. If you remove the `private` field or change its value to `false`, the second page will become publicly available and can be viewed by anyone.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 50914701392, 'load_duration': 2830284, 'prompt_eval_count': 1985, 'prompt_eval_duration': 7872939000, 'eval_count': 259, 'eval_duration': 42857598000}
