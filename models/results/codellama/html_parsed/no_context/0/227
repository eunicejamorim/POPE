It\'s important to respect people\'s privacy and boundaries, especially when it comes to sensitive information like their personal preferences.\n\nInstead of asking whether the page should be private to a certain user, you could try to understand their perspective and how they might feel about having their page shared with others. This can help you better understand their needs and concerns, and avoid any misunderstandings or uncomfortable situations.\n\nFor example, if someone is unsure about sharing their page with others, you could ask them if they would be comfortable discussing their privacy settings with you. You could also try to understand why they might have concerns about sharing their page, and see if there are any ways to address those concerns.\n\nOverall, it\'s important to prioritize people\'s privacy and boundaries, and to respect their decision-making power when it comes to sharing their personal information with others.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 42084335324, 'load_duration': 1745020, 'prompt_eval_count': 1704, 'prompt_eval_duration': 6461718000, 'eval_count': 226, 'eval_duration': 35494901000}
