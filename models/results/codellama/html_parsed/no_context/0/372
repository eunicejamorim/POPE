It includes an iframe element with a specific src attribute, which is used to load the content of another page in the current HTML file. This technique is known as "iframe sandboxing" and it is commonly used to embed external content within a web page while maintaining control over its behavior.\n\nIn this case, the iframe element is hidden using CSS by setting the display property to none and visibility property to hidden. It also has an id attribute with value "AfFEC4ictJTQOdzK", which is used later in the code. The rest of the code is related to the Grammarly web application, which is a grammar and spell checker that can be integrated into web pages using JavaScript.\n\nOverall, this code snippet is likely used for embedding the Grammarly web application within the Macys website and ensuring that it works correctly with their existing design and functionality.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 49075965870, 'load_duration': 3390272, 'prompt_eval_count': 1998, 'prompt_eval_duration': 7879454000, 'eval_count': 249, 'eval_duration': 40953279000}
