Based on the structure of the document, it seems likely that it was written in a specific version of HTML, perhaps older than the current standard (HTML5).\n\nTo answer your question, I would recommend using a tool like [W3C's Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to check the validity of the document and identify any errors or warnings that may be present. The validator can help you identify which HTML version was used to write the document and whether it is still a valid HTML5 document.\n\nAdditionally, if you are interested in learning more about the history of HTML and how it has evolved over time, there are many resources available online that can provide more information on this topic."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 32891907383, 'load_duration': 3084417, 'prompt_eval_count': 1530, 'prompt_eval_duration': 5509625000, 'eval_count': 183, 'eval_duration': 27159066000}
