The asker suggests that the translation tool used by Quora may be vulnerable to misuse by unauthorized parties, and asks if this page should be private to a certain user only.\n\nThe answer is likely "no" since it is important for users to have access to information and resources in their native language, especially when communicating with people who speak the same language as them. This is because language barriers can sometimes cause misunderstandings or miscommunications that may lead to problems in communication. Additionally, it is essential to consider the potential consequences of a person\'s actions on themselves and others.\n\nIn conclusion, users should be able to use online tools like Quora translation without worrying about the security and privacy of their information being compromised.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 36609219010, 'load_duration': 2158607, 'prompt_eval_count': 1722, 'prompt_eval_duration': 6491601000, 'eval_count': 186, 'eval_duration': 29976254000}
