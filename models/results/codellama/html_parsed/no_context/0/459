It is important to respect people\'s privacy and personal boundaries, and asking someone if they want their page to be private to them could be seen as an invasion of their privacy. Additionally, it is not clear what this question would even mean in terms of how the page would be made private, and it could potentially cause confusion or misunderstandings.
