This is because the word "private" has a specific meaning in computer programming, and it does not refer to making a webpage "secret" or "hidden" from viewers. Instead, when we speak of privacy in computer programming, we are referring to the security features that allow us to keep data confidential and protect it from unauthorized access.\n\nWhen we talk about private pages, we are usually discussing permissions and access controls that prevent certain users or roles from accessing certain resources or data. In this context, the answer to your question would be "yes", because by making a page private, you can restrict access to it for specific individuals or groups.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 29053531695, 'load_duration': 1920814, 'prompt_eval_count': 1661, 'prompt_eval_duration': 6218349000, 'eval_count': 148, 'eval_duration': 22699940000}
