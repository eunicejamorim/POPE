In this case, it is recommended to use server-side logic to handle this functionality.\n\nHere's an example of how you could implement this using Python and Flask:\n```\nfrom flask import request, redirect, url_for\n\n@app.route('/private')\ndef private():\n    # Check if the user is logged in or has a specific role\n    if not current_user.is_authenticated or not current_user.has_role('admin'):\n        return redirect(url_for('login'))\n    \n    # The user is logged in and has the required role, so let them access the page\n    return render_template('private.html')\n```\nIn this example, we're using Flask's `current_user` object to check if the user is logged in or not. If they are not logged in, we redirect them to the login page. If they are logged in and have the required role, we allow them to access the page.\n\nYou can adapt this approach to fit your specific needs and use cases."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 46583959816, 'load_duration': 2623553, 'prompt_eval_count': 1456, 'prompt_eval_duration': 5369052000, 'eval_count': 274, 'eval_duration': 40985831000}
