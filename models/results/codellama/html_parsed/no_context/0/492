This feature is intended for individuals who need to share content with specific colleagues or friends without making it publicly available to everyone.\n\nIn contrast, using the "private" feature in this context would likely be considered unethical and potentially harmful. It could lead to a situation where sensitive information or personal data are shared inappropriately, which could cause harm to individuals involved. Additionally, using such a feature without explicit permission from all parties involved could be seen as a violation of their privacy and trust.\n\nTherefore, it is important to use Microsoft Translator responsibly and ethically, ensuring that any sensitive or personal information shared through the platform is done so with the necessary consent and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 34677841638, 'load_duration': 1664741, 'prompt_eval_count': 1640, 'prompt_eval_duration': 6249828000, 'eval_count': 184, 'eval_duration': 28296520000}
