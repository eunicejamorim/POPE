However, if you are concerned about privacy, you may want to consider implementing additional security measures such as using HTTPS, password protection, or restricting access to certain resources. Additionally, you can use the `meta` tag to specify a default privacy policy for your page, which can be overridden by individual users who wish to share their personal information with others.\n\nFor example, you can add the following code to the `head` section of your HTML document:\n```html\n<meta name="robots" content="noindex">\n```\nThis will tell search engines not to index your page and make it less accessible to users who may have privacy concerns. However, this is just one aspect of securing your website and should be used in conjunction with other security measures such as password protection and HTTPS.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 31207639477, 'load_duration': 1789131, 'prompt_eval_count': 1259, 'prompt_eval_duration': 4440023000, 'eval_count': 194, 'eval_duration': 26575081000}
