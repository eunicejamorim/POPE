The purpose of the widget is to provide a convenient way for visitors to access translation services without having to navigate away from the current page. By using the widget, visitors can easily translate text on your website or blog without leaving the page.\n\nIf you want to restrict access to certain content based on user authentication, you could use a different approach such as integrating with an identity management system like Azure AD.
