It is not ethical or legal to use automation tools like Grammarly to write a letter that appears to be written by someone else without their consent. The person who wrote the letter has the right to be recognized as the author of their own work, and it is important to respect those rights.\n\nIf you are tasked with writing a letter on behalf of someone else, it is important to get permission from that person before doing so. This can involve asking for their consent in writing or verbally, or simply asking if they would like you to write the letter for them. It is also important to be transparent about who the author of the letter is and to give credit where credit is due.\n\nIn general, it is always best to err on the side of caution when it comes to using automation tools to write letters or any other kind of document. It is important to respect the rights and privacy of others, and using automation tools without their consent can lead to unintended consequences that may not be desirable.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 39095860086, 'load_duration': 3561834, 'prompt_eval_count': 1541, 'prompt_eval_duration': 5678967000, 'eval_count': 223, 'eval_duration': 33263646000}
