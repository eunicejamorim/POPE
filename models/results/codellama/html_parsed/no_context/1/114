The page contains a lot of potentially harmful code that could be used for malicious purposes if executed by an untrusted user.\n\nThe `onetrust_sdk` script contains several potential security vulnerabilities, including:\n\n1. Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks: This script uses `eval()` to execute arbitrary JavaScript code, which can lead to XSS attacks if the user has malicious input.\n2. Code injection: The script uses a lot of dynamic code generation, which can make it vulnerable to code injection attacks where an attacker injects their own code into the page.\n3. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks: This script contains a form that submits data to another domain, which makes it vulnerable to CSRF attacks.\n4. SQL injection: The script uses MySQL queries with dynamic input, which can make it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.\n\nTo ensure the safety of your website and its users, you should avoid using this script without proper validation and sanitization of user input. Instead, consider using a safer alternative that does not contain any potential security vulnerabilities.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 51177791192, 'load_duration': 2630241, 'prompt_eval_count': 1847, 'prompt_eval_duration': 7019300000, 'eval_count': 270, 'eval_duration': 43988717000}
