While Instagram does have a feature for allowing certain pages to be public, it is generally not recommended to make your profile public to everyone by default. Instead, you can choose to make specific parts of your profile public or private, such as your posts and stories, and only share them with people who are supposed to see them. This allows you to control the information that is available to others and helps keep your personal life and identity separate from your online presence.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 19187715778, 'load_duration': 2633515, 'prompt_eval_count': 1298, 'prompt_eval_duration': 4666548000, 'eval_count': 106, 'eval_duration': 14323222000}
