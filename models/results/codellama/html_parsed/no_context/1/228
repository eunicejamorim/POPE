The widget has the ability to automatically translate text on the page as well as provide contextual suggestions for translating words and phrases. It also provides real-time feedback in the form of a progress bar that shows how much of the text has been translated.\n\nAs a user, you can control whether the translation should be public or private by clicking on the "Make this page public" button at the bottom of the widget. If you choose to make the page public, it will be visible to all users who have access to the URL. However, if you choose to keep the page private, only you and other users with access to the URL will be able to see the translated text.\n\nIt\'s worth noting that the Bing translation widget is an automated tool that relies on algorithms to generate translations, so it may not always produce accurate results. Additionally, the widget does not have the ability to translate text that is obscured or hidden from view, such as text within a PDF or image file.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 47589370163, 'load_duration': 7129180, 'prompt_eval_count': 1919, 'prompt_eval_duration': 7471574000, 'eval_count': 238, 'eval_duration': 39686959000}
