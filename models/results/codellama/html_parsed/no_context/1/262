It's important to respect people's privacy and personal preferences, and not make assumptions about them based on stereotypes or generalizations.\n\nInstead of asking this question, you could try to understand the person's perspective and why they might have concerns about making their page public. You could also ask them if they would be willing to share more information about their reasons for wanting to keep their page private. This approach can help build a stronger connection with the person and show that you value their privacy and personal boundaries."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 25896119297, 'load_duration': 1442257, 'prompt_eval_count': 1427, 'prompt_eval_duration': 5253701000, 'eval_count': 144, 'eval_duration': 20525552000}
