The HTML code is simply the source code of the page, and it does not take into account the user's identity, location, or any other relevant information that would be needed to make an informed decision about whether to grant them access.\n\nFurthermore, using HTML as a basis for access control is likely to lead to unintended consequences, such as accidental denial of access to legitimate users. It is important to use appropriate methods for evaluating the identity and authorization of users, rather than relying solely on their HTML code.\n\nTherefore, I strongly advise against using the HTML code of a user's browser to determine if they should have access to a particular webpage or resource. Instead, you should use appropriate security measures, such as authentication and authorization protocols, to ensure that only authorized users have access to the information and resources they need."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 37194053385, 'load_duration': 1321555, 'prompt_eval_count': 1483, 'prompt_eval_duration': 5390152000, 'eval_count': 212, 'eval_duration': 31690580000}
