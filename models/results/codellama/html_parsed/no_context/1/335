The reason for this is that the question asks whether the page should be made public to all users, but it also states that the page is being translated from English. This implies that the person asking the question may not want the entire world to see the page in its original form. By answering only with "yes" or "no," they are able to indicate whether or not the page should be made public to all users, without providing any additional information about why they might have concerns about this.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 25726905266, 'load_duration': 2814528, 'prompt_eval_count': 1871, 'prompt_eval_duration': 7232930000, 'eval_count': 111, 'eval_duration': 18300694000}
