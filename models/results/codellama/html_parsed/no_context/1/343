Injection attacks: An attacker could potentially inject malicious code into the page by setting the `innerHTML` property to a value that includes scripts or other malicious elements. This could allow an attacker to steal sensitive data, modify the page, or perform other malicious actions.\n2. Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks: A similar issue to injection attacks, XSS attacks can also be prevented by setting the `innerHTML` property to a value that includes scripts or other malicious elements.\n3. Untrusted data: If the `innerHTML` property is set to a value that comes from an untrusted source, it could potentially contain malicious content that should not be executed on the page.\n4. Compliance issues: Depending on the regulatory requirements of your project, it may be necessary to ensure that the page is compliant with certain standards and regulations. Using the `innerHTML` property in a way that violates these requirements could lead to legal issues.\n\nInstead of using the `innerHTML` property, you should use a safer method of setting the inner HTML content of an element. One option is to use the `textContent` property, which allows you to set the text content of an element without executing any script or other malicious code. Another option is to use a library or framework that provides a more robust way of handling HTML content, such as React or Angular.\n\nIn general, it's important to carefully consider the potential risks and limitations of using the `innerHTML` property in any given situation, and to choose a safer alternative whenever possible."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 73088970332, 'load_duration': 5341641, 'prompt_eval_count': 1854, 'prompt_eval_duration': 7186149000, 'eval_count': 399, 'eval_duration': 65579356000}
