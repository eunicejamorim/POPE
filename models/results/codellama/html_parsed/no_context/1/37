It's important to respect people's privacy and security online, especially when it comes to sensitive information like their email address.

Instead of allowing everyone to view the email address, you could consider adding an option for users to share their contact information through a secure channel, such as a private message or a designated forum.\n\nThis way, you can still encourage users to share your content with others, but you'll be able to keep their personal information safe and secure."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 28684207947, 'load_duration': 6911165, 'prompt_eval_count': 1285, 'prompt_eval_duration': 4847224000, 'eval_count': 171, 'eval_duration': 23468104000}
