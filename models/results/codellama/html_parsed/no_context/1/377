The widget contains a number of proprietary elements and JavaScript code that is specific to the Microsoft Translator service and cannot be easily modified or used outside of that context. Additionally, the widget is intended for use on a single page, so using it on multiple pages would likely violate the terms of service for the Microsoft Translator API.\n\nIf you want to allow users to translate content on your website, there are several other options available that do not involve using the Bing Translator widget. For example, you could use a third-party translation API like Google Translate or Yandex Translate, which offer free and paid options for translating text. You could also consider implementing machine learning-based language models to perform automatic translation on your website.\n\nIt is important to ensure that any content translation technology you use does not violate the terms of service for the API being used, and that you obtain the necessary licenses or permissions from third parties before using their intellectual property in this way.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 40255277748, 'load_duration': 3027497, 'prompt_eval_count': 1486, 'prompt_eval_duration': 5486199000, 'eval_count': 234, 'eval_duration': 34567735000}
