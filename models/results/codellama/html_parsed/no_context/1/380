This would allow anyone who knows the URL of the page to access and view its contents without any authentication or authorization checks in place.\n\nInstead, you can consider implementing a more fine-grained access control mechanism that allows only authorized users to access certain parts of the page or specific features within it. For example, you could use role-based authentication, where different users are assigned different roles that determine their level of access to various parts of the page.\n\nAdditionally, you can also consider using authorization mechanisms such as permissions or access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access to specific resources within the page based on user identity, roles, or other factors. This would allow you to fine-tune the level of access granted to each user and ensure that sensitive information is only accessible by authorized users.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 33745457146, 'load_duration': 3290181, 'prompt_eval_count': 1446, 'prompt_eval_duration': 5356594000, 'eval_count': 188, 'eval_duration': 28155254000}
