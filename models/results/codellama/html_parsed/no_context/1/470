Additionally, this type of question can be seen as invasive and may cause confusion or frustration for the user.\n\nInstead, you could ask more specific questions related to the content of the page, such as "What kind of information do you want to share with other users?" or "Do you have any specific requirements or guidelines for sharing this information?"
