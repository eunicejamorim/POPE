The `setTimeout` function is used to delay the execution of the script for 0 milliseconds, which means it will execute immediately after the HTML document has been parsed. This can allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the webpage and potentially take control of the user's browser or steal sensitive information such as login credentials or credit card numbers. Therefore, it is recommended to avoid using `setTimeout` with a delay time of 0 milliseconds in the context of web development."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 22095917782, 'load_duration': 3332800, 'prompt_eval_count': 1455, 'prompt_eval_duration': 5375785000, 'eval_count': 115, 'eval_duration': 16491935000}
