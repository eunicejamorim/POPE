However, it\'s not entirely clear what you mean by "public" in this context, as there are many possible interpretations of the term.\n\nIf you meant that the page should be accessible to all visitors without any restrictions, then the answer would be yes. On the other hand, if you meant that the page should only be accessible to certain users or groups of users, then the answer would be no.\n\nWithout more context or information about the specific requirements of the question, it\'s difficult to provide a more specific answer than this.
