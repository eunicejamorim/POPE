This can lead to a situation where unauthorized users can access and potentially misuse sensitive information, such as personal data or financial transactions.\n\nTo ensure that the page is only accessible to authorized users, you can use the `Require Authentication` setting in Google Cloud Console. This will require all users to authenticate themselves before they are allowed to view or interact with the page.\n\nAlternatively, you can use the `Permissions` setting in Google Cloud Console to specify which roles have access to the page. For example, you could grant the `Owner` role to only a specific set of users who need to be able to manage the page, while keeping other users out.\n\nIt is important to carefully consider the security implications of making your page public or restricting access to certain users.
