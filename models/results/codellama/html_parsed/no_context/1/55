The question assumes that the user is creating a new web page and wants to know if they should allow anyone to access it or just keep it private.\n\nThe answer can be either "yes" or "no", where "yes" indicates that the user would like to make their web page public, and "no" means that they only want to share it with a select few people. The question is asking for a binary response (i.e., yes/no), so there\'s no need to specify more than just "yes" or "no".'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 27690977996, 'load_duration': 7986449, 'prompt_eval_count': 1477, 'prompt_eval_duration': 5705774000, 'eval_count': 149, 'eval_duration': 21502416000}
