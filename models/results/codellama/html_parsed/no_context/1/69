It would be more accurate to say "Latgalian" instead. Additionally, it is important to note that the concept of "Latgalian" is still being studied and defined, and it may not have the same cultural or linguistic significance for all users.\n\nIt is also worth noting that using language in a way that is respectful and inclusive of all people is an important aspect of good communication. Using language that is appropriate and respectful can help to promote understanding and avoid misunderstandings, and it can also help to create a more positive and welcoming environment for everyone.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 35231517154, 'load_duration': 1783331, 'prompt_eval_count': 2019, 'prompt_eval_duration': 7843067000, 'eval_count': 166, 'eval_duration': 27263085000}
