The user interface is designed to be minimalistic and easy to use, with a dropdown menu for selecting the source and target languages, as well as a text input field where the user can enter the text they want to translate. When the user clicks on the "Translate" button, the application will make an AJAX request to the Microsoft Translator API to retrieve the translation of the entered text. The response from the API is then displayed in the application\'s output area.\n\nThe application also includes a few additional features such as the ability to copy the translated text to the clipboard, as well as the option to share the translated page with others via email or social media. These features are implemented using HTML5\'s `navigator.clipboard` API and the `mailto:` protocol for sharing.\n\nOverall, this is a simple but functional web application that demonstrates how to use the Microsoft Translator API to translate text in a web application.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 39197594975, 'load_duration': 2477853, 'prompt_eval_count': 1472, 'prompt_eval_duration': 5355394000, 'eval_count': 225, 'eval_duration': 33637045000}
