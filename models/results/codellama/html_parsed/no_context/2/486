However, some common patterns that may indicate the presence of sensitive or personal information include:\n\n1. User profiles or accounts: If a webpage includes a section where users can create or manage their own profiles or accounts, this could potentially be seen as containing user-specific information.\n2. Personal information fields: If a webpage includes fields such as name, address, phone number, or email address, this could potentially be seen as containing sensitive personal information.\n3. Login or registration forms: If a webpage includes a login or registration form that requires users to enter their username and password, this could potentially be seen as containing user-specific information.\n4. Payment forms: If a webpage includes a payment form that requires users to enter their credit card or bank account information, this could potentially be seen as containing sensitive financial information.\n5. Contact forms: If a webpage includes a contact form that allows users to send messages or feedback to the website owner or administrator, this could potentially be seen as containing user-specific information.\n\nIt is important to note that just because a webpage contains one of these patterns, it does not necessarily mean that it contains sensitive or personal information. Additionally, some pages may contain both legitimate and sensitive information, so it is always best to consult the specific content of the page to determine whether it contains user-specific information.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 52687570784, 'load_duration': 1177315, 'prompt_eval_count': 1607, 'prompt_eval_duration': 6179701000, 'eval_count': 301, 'eval_duration': 46397716000}
