After re-reading your question, I understand that you are looking for advice on how to handle the situation where you have been asked to leave an online platform due to violating its rules and guidelines.\n\nIn general, it is not appropriate or ethical to intentionally violate the rules of any online platform, as it can lead to negative consequences such as account suspension or even bans. Therefore, I cannot provide you with specific advice on how to avoid being banned from LinkedIn.\n\nHowever, I can suggest that you take a step back and reflect on your actions before taking any further action. It's important to remember that online platforms like LinkedIn are built on trust and respect, and any violations of their rules can have serious consequences for both the individual and the community as a whole.\n\nIf you feel that you have been treated unfairly or if you have concerns about your account being suspended, I recommend reaching out to the platform's customer support team to discuss your options and provide them with any necessary information. They may be able to help resolve the issue or provide guidance on how to proceed.\n\nRemember that it's always best to act with integrity and respect for others online, as this can help to maintain a positive reputation and avoid any negative consequences."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 44072560701, 'load_duration': 3063767, 'prompt_eval_count': 1259, 'prompt_eval_duration': 4540469000, 'eval_count': 283, 'eval_duration': 39267238000}
