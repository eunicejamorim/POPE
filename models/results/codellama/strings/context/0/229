The article includes information about Grogu's species, Kelleran Beq, his role in the Star Wars universe, and his relationships with other characters such as Yoda and Ahsoka Tano.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Fandom community-created content may not always be accurate or up-to-date, and should be used with caution. Additionally, Fandom's terms of service require users to provide real information and create an account before creating content on the platform. It is also possible for a user to change their username or email address after creating an account, which could potentially affect the accuracy of their contributions.\n\nTherefore, it is important to approach any information found on Fandom with a critical eye and consult multiple sources before making any conclusions or decisions based on that information. Additionally, it is always best to verify information through official sources, such as Star Wars Databank or the Star Wars Insider magazine."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 36825539295, 'load_duration': 2409446, 'prompt_eval_count': 1093, 'prompt_eval_duration': 3991036000, 'eval_count': 247, 'eval_duration': 32671637000}
