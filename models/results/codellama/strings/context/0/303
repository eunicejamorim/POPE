One reason is the rise in value of the teams themselves, as they have become more attractive investment opportunities due to their potential return on investment (ROI). The revenue generated by Formula 1 has increased, with teams receiving a higher share of the total income.\n\nAnother reason for the growth in investments is the changing dynamics of the sport. Formula 1 has become more accessible and diverse, thanks to the rise of streaming services like Netflix and social media platforms that have helped to increase the sport's reach and popularity. This has led to a greater interest in the sport among younger audiences, who are more likely to be attracted to investing in teams that are seen as successful and exciting.\n\nThe investments made by team owners can also have a significant impact on the sport itself. For example, Liberty Media, the company behind Netflix's Formula 1 content, has invested heavily in modernizing the sport and expanding its reach. This has included adding new races, such as in Miami and Las Vegas, and exploring new opportunities for sponsorship and advertising revenue. As a result of these investments, the sport has become more commercially viable and has seen increased revenues for teams.\n\nMoreover, the increase in investments among team owners can also lead to changes in the way that the sport is run. For example, Liberty Media's move to adopt a franchise model for its teams, where the value of the teams is protected and new teams are charged a higher anti-dilution fee, has helped to enhance the value of the existing 10 teams and protect their exclusive rights. This can lead to increased revenue for teams and a more stable future for the sport.\n\nIn conclusion, the investments made by team owners in Formula 1 are likely driven by the rise in value of the teams themselves, as well as changes in the dynamics of the sport that make it more accessible and commercially viable. These investments can have significant impacts on the sport, leading to increased revenues for teams and changes in how it is run."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 85157167600, 'load_duration': 1437988, 'prompt_eval_count': 1659, 'prompt_eval_duration': 6223914000, 'eval_count': 484, 'eval_duration': 78816098000}
