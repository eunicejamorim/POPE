This page is displayed to all users who visit the site and provides a brief overview of Wikipedia and its policies. The page also includes links to several other important pages on the site, such as the Privacy Policy, Disclaimers, and Code of Conduct. Additionally, it allows users to opt out of mentorship if they prefer not to have a specific mentor assigned to them, or if they want a different mentor altogether.\n\nIf you are new to editing Wikipedia, it is recommended that you start by trying out some easy tasks to learn the basics of editing on the site. This can include adding links between articles, copyediting (fixing spelling, grammar, and tone), and expanding short articles. However, if you have learned about Wikipedia best practices and are ready to create a new article or update existing ones, you can move on to more advanced tasks such as finding references (sources for existing articles), updating articles, and expanding them further.\n\nTo get help with editing, you can ask your mentor for assistance. Your mentor is another experienced Wikipedia editor who has volunteered to guide newer editors like you in how to use the site effectively. When you send a message to your mentor, he will see it on his user talk page and you should receive a notification when he replies. You can also opt out of mentorship if you prefer not to have a specific mentor assigned to you right now or if you want a different mentor altogether.\n\nIt is important to note that editing on Wikipedia requires adherence to certain guidelines and policies, as detailed in the Terms of Use and Creative Commons license. When publishing changes, users must agree to release their contributions under the CC BY-SA 4.0 License and the GFDL .

It also allows users to opt out of mentorship if they prefer not to have a specific mentor assigned to them or if they want a different mentor altogether.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 70092743659, 'load_duration': 1109964, 'prompt_eval_count': 1051, 'prompt_eval_duration': 4024440000, 'eval_count': 485, 'eval_duration': 65928734000}
