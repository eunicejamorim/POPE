TradingView does not store your payment credentials and uses an API provided by Braintree (owned by PayPal) to process payments. This means that your payment information is protected and kept private. Additionally, TradingView offers a variety of payment methods on their website, including all major credit cards, PayPal accounts, Apple Pay, and crypto payments. Crypto payments are only available for annual plans, and Coinbase handles the payment processing.\nYou can cancel anytime and it will not auto-renew after the current paid term. Paid service will remain active for the duration of the paid term. A canceled trial will stop immediately after cancellation. TradingView also has a refund policy, which allows for refunds only after an automatic deduction for annual payments (i.e. after trial and after renewal) within 14 calendar days after the payment was made.\nYou can upgrade your annual subscription at any time with no extra transactions needed. All remaining days of your current plan will be automatically converted into equivalent value days on the new tier. You don\'t lose anything, just use the remaining amount to switch to a better version. Thus, the remaining period of your subscription will be reduced and your next payment date will be switched.\nYou can downgrade at any time and your current plan will stay exactly as it is until its subscription date. Then, once it expires, your new downgraded plan will go live at the selected rate.\nTradingView offers extra real-time data for exchanges that are available to be added separately to your account. To add data, you first need to have one of their paid plans or to be a trial member. You can also find all global data available to you on TradingView\'s website. Extra real-time data is only available on the TradingView website and only for users who purchased the data from eligible exchanges with their paid TradingView account.\nThe difference between professional and non-professional subscriptions is that “Professional” usage relates to common business activity where market data is used on behalf of businesses or entities, funds or asset managers. “Non-Professional” usage refers to market data for personal use only. This means that any person who uses market data as a retail customer or market hobbyist is a Non-professional user while those who use market data on behalf of an employer or engages in the trading between businesses or entities, is considered to be a Professional user.\nYou can still buy a professional plan if you\'re not a professional trader. All their very best features are available in one package, including more alerts, data, multiple charts, and more. If you need more than non-professional plans provide, you can purchase any of the professional plans.\nCookies policy: Cookies policy: This website uses cookies to improve your experience on our site.
