The horizontal line at 894.4 is resistance and is not yet broken, so it may take some time for the price to reach this level again before it starts to fall.\n\nThe chart also shows a bullish trendline that is currently above the price of the stock, which suggests that the stock may continue to rise in the near term. However, it's important to keep in mind that charts are just one tool for analyzing market data and should be used in conjunction with other factors such as fundamental analysis before making any investment decisions."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 24058866377, 'load_duration': 1081189, 'prompt_eval_count': 1259, 'prompt_eval_duration': 4400126000, 'eval_count': 144, 'eval_duration': 19518017000}
