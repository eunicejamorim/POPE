The average refund amount for American taxpayers is around $3140, according to IRS data as of February 2023. However, the refund time frame may vary, with more than 9 out of 10 refunds being issued within 21 days.\n\nThe TurboTax product line offers various editions and features, such as Deluxe, Premium, Full Service, and Assisted Business Taxes. The company also provides customer service and support options, with hours and options varying by time of year.\n\nIn addition to tax preparation software, TurboTax also offers other products like Tax Resources for Self-Employed & Investors, TurboTax for Military Benefits, and TurboTax Business Tax Online.\n\nIt's worth noting that while TurboTax is known for its convenience and ease of use, it may not be the best option for everyone.
