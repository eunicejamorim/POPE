The GDPR applies to organizations that handle large amounts of personal data, such as companies that collect data on behalf of other businesses, or those that create online services for consumers.\nThe GDPR has four main principles:\n1. Transparency: Organizations must be transparent about how they collect and use personal data. They must also inform individuals about how their data is used, who it is shared with, and what rights they have.\n2. Consent: Individuals must give consent before their personal data can be collected and used. This means that organizations cannot collect data without the individual's permission.\n3. Data minimization: Organizations should only collect the personal data that is necessary for their purposes. They should also not use more data than what is necessary to achieve those purposes.\n4. Data protection by design and by default: Organizations should have data protection measures in place from the start, rather than just adding them later. This means that organizations should have appropriate security measures in place to protect personal data, as well as policies in place to ensure that data is collected and used responsibly.\nThe GDPR also applies specific rights to individuals under the Act. These include:\n1. Right to access: Individuals have the right to request any personal data that they have provided to an organization. They must also be able to see how their data is being used and what categories it has been categorized into.\n2. Right to rectification: Individuals have the right to request that their personal data be corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete.\n3. Right to erasure: Individuals have the right to request that an organization delete any personal data that they have provided, unless there is a valid reason for keeping it.\n4. Restriction of processing: Individuals have the right to limit how their personal data is used by an organization. This means that they can stop an organization from using their data for marketing purposes, for example.\n5. Right to object: Individuals have the right to object to the processing of their personal data under certain circumstances. For example, if an organization is using automated decision-making processes that are not transparent and accountable.\nThe GDPR also applies strict penalties to organizations that fail to comply with its rules. These penalties can include fines, as well as other consequences such as the loss of a company's right to carry out business in the EU."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 83091283223, 'load_duration': 1409433, 'prompt_eval_count': 1257, 'prompt_eval_duration': 4399100000, 'eval_count': 543, 'eval_duration': 78548301000}
