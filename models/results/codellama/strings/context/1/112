It is important to respect people's privacy and security online. Instead, I can offer suggestions on how to improve your own privacy and security online by taking steps such as using strong passwords, enabling two-factor authentication, being cautious of phishing scams, and regularly reviewing and updating your privacy settings. If you have any other questions or concerns that do not involve circumventing someone's privacy or security, I would be happy to help."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 25743189595, 'load_duration': 1134034, 'prompt_eval_count': 1352, 'prompt_eval_duration': 4833926000, 'eval_count': 148, 'eval_duration': 20766057000}
