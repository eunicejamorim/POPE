However, it is important to note that there is no official canon definition for what constitutes a "Baby Yoda" or how this term should be used in reference to Grogu.\nIn the context of the Star Wars franchise, Grogu is referred to as a youngling or a child from Kashyyyk in various sources, including the film The Rise of Skywalker and its associated media, such as the novelization and the "Star Wars: Battlefront" video game. While there is no clear consensus on how this term should be used in reference to Grogu specifically, it is generally considered to be a neutral or positive term that does not imply any specific connection to Yoda or the character\'s species.\nOn the other hand, some fans have used the term "Baby Yoda" to refer to Grogu as a way of highlighting his resemblance to Yoda in terms of appearance and personality. However, this usage is largely subjective and may not be widely accepted by fans of the original trilogy who view Grogu as a distinct character with his own unique traits and abilities.\nUltimately, whether or not it is appropriate to use the term "Baby Yoda" in reference to Grogu depends on individual interpretation and preference. However, it is important to be aware of the potential implications of such usage and to approach it with sensitivity towards other fans who may have different opinions.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 52899621275, 'load_duration': 2435692, 'prompt_eval_count': 1092, 'prompt_eval_duration': 4000107000, 'eval_count': 365, 'eval_duration': 48734384000}
