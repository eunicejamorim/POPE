For the illustration, manga & novel posting event "RainRainRain2024", we invite you to post your works on the theme of rain. All types of work and all genres are okay. Freely create an illustration, manga, or novel (including poetry, tanka, essays, and more) using your preferred method and style. In Japan June brings the rainy season. What images come to mind when you think of the enduring rain? Do you hold an umbrella alone, or share it with someone? It\'s the season to enjoy the comforting sound of raindrops, the sight of hydrangeas glistening with moisture, fruits shedding water, puddles left after the rain, and rainbows appearing during breaks in the clouds. All show the varied faces of the rainy season. Rain is also a versatile theme in art, often evoking feelings of melancholy or symbolizing renewal and purification. We eagerly await a wide range of works themed around rain! 30 winners will be chosen by raffle from among all participants to receive an Amazon gift code (1000 JPY value).
