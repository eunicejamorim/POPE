This method involves dividing the learning material into smaller blocks, with each block focusing on a specific aspect of the dental field. The blocks are then combined to form a larger learning module, which can be completed by students in a structured manner.\nThe Endodontics Blocks Training method is designed to provide a more efficient and effective way of learning compared to traditional methods. By breaking the learning material down into smaller blocks, it allows students to focus on specific topics and review them at their own pace. This approach also helps students to retain information better as they are able to apply it in a more meaningful way.\nIn addition to the Endodontics Blocks Training method, AliExpress also offers other training methods for dental teeth practice, such as Root Canal Files Study and Resin RCT Demo Student Dentistry Teaching. These methods provide students with a more comprehensive understanding of the field, while also allowing them to learn at their own pace.\nOverall, the model that AliExpress uses for training their dental teeth practice is an effective way of promoting learning and retention in the field. By breaking down the learning material into smaller blocks and providing students with a structured approach to completing their studies, they are able to provide students with a more efficient and effective way of learning.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 53009893440, 'load_duration': 1325146, 'prompt_eval_count': 1689, 'prompt_eval_duration': 6441061000, 'eval_count': 294, 'eval_duration': 46423047000}
