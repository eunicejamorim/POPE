Instead, you could consider creating a registration process that asks for only the necessary information to complete the task or activity being requested. For example, if you are asking someone to provide their email address to receive updates on a particular product or service, you could ask for it directly in the context of the request, rather than sharing it without their consent."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 27140687212, 'load_duration': 1348647, 'prompt_eval_count': 233, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1289143000, 'eval_count': 161, 'eval_duration': 25701892000}
