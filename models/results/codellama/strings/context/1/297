The privacy of individuals should be respected and protected, especially in today's world where data breaches and cyber attacks are becoming more frequent. It is important for websites and online platforms to be transparent about how they handle user data and to obtain informed consent before sharing any personal information with third parties.\n\nAs a result, I would advise against sharing such personal information without the user's consent. Instead, it would be better to ask for explicit permission from the user before sharing their personal information. This approach not only protects the user's privacy but also helps build trust and credibility with them."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 30259823976, 'load_duration': 1341097, 'prompt_eval_count': 1536, 'prompt_eval_duration': 5494152000, 'eval_count': 166, 'eval_duration': 24636547000}
