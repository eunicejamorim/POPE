The author notes that Eminem has been criticized for not taking a strong stance against Trump and other political figures in his music, but he has also been praised for his efforts to use his platform for social commentary. The article highlights the contrast between older audiences who see censorship as a threat to artistic freedom, and younger generations who view it as essential for accountability. The author also discusses Eminem's attempts to return to his old style, which have not always been well received by Gen Z audiences, with some calling for him to be cancelled. However, Eminem has responded to online criticism and apologized for using a homophobic slur against Tyler, the Creator. The author suggests that this could be an effort on Eminem's part to secure his legacy and ensure that he is remembered as a controversial figure rather than simply a successful artist."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 40151502571, 'load_duration': 1034143, 'prompt_eval_count': 1474, 'prompt_eval_duration': 5372529000, 'eval_count': 236, 'eval_duration': 34633301000}
