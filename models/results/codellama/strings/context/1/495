{'model': 'codellama', 'created_at': '2024-06-08T15:42:13.701919928Z', 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '\nThe book "Acoustic Signals and Hearing" by Mikio Tohyama provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamental principles of acoustics and hearing, as well as their applications in various fields. The book covers source-signature and sound-path analysis, which are crucial for understanding the properties of sound waves and their effects on the human auditory system.\n\nThe authors provide a clear and intuitive explanation of the basics of acoustics and audio engineering via timeless topics such as linear system theory in the time and frequency domains. They also employ the new envelope and phase analysis approach to signal and waveform analysis, which offers new perspectives on how to solve acoustical problems.\n\nThe book provides straightforward mathematical formulations that give familiarity to discrete expressions of sound waves. Additionally, it presents unique sounds and sound fields from the perspective of hearing, covering source-signature and sound-path analysis. The authors provide a reconstruction of the basics of acoustics and audio engineering via timeless topics such as linear system theory in the time and frequency domains.\n\nThe book offers new perspectives on ways to solve acoustical problems through phase properties. It also provides a seamless and intuitive understandingâ€”from mathematical expressions to a subjective impression of sound. The book is an excellent resource for researchers, educators, and students interested in the fundamental principles of acoustics and hearing as well as their applications in various fields.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 49143615907, 'load_duration': 1238935, 'prompt_eval_count': 1317, 'prompt_eval_duration': 4647477000, 'eval_count': 311, 'eval_duration': 44355996000}
