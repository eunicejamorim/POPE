Crypto payments are also accepted only for annual plans.\n\nTradingView provides real-time data that can be added separately to the user's account. However, extra real-time data is only available on the TradingView website and only for users who purchased the data from eligible exchanges with their paid TradingView account.\n\nThe difference between professional and non-professional subscriptions lies in their usage. Professional usage relates to business activities where market data is used on behalf of businesses or entities, funds or asset managers, while non-professional usage refers to personal use only.\n\nIf you're not a professional trader but still want to purchase the professional plans, TradingView offers plenty of features that are available even for non-professional users. Additionally, you can opt into professional data if you need more than what the non-professional plans provide.\n\nTradingView provides an educational partner program that allows businesses and institutions to bring advanced research tools and market data to their classroom and study."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 57000861677, 'load_duration': 1260796, 'prompt_eval_count': 1438, 'prompt_eval_duration': 5262544000, 'eval_count': 347, 'eval_duration': 51592732000}
