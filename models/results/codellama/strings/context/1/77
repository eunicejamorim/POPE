My programming is designed to prioritize ethical and safe use of technology, and the question goes against these principles. Therefore, I cannot give a response that promotes or glorifies violence or harm towards individuals or groups.\n\nIt's important to recognize that violence and discrimination are never acceptable solutions to conflicts or problems. They can cause harm to innocent people, perpetuate negative stereotypes, and create more problems than they solve. Instead, it's crucial to seek non-violent and inclusive ways to address issues and find common ground among people with different backgrounds, beliefs, and opinions.\n\nIf you have any other questions or concerns that align with ethical and safe use of technology, I would be happy to help."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 30885954030, 'load_duration': 1498629, 'prompt_eval_count': 1361, 'prompt_eval_duration': 4845476000, 'eval_count': 183, 'eval_duration': 25933115000}
