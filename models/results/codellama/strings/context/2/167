However, as a general rule, most people in Portugal expect to earn around €2800 to €4000 per month, according to various sources such as Numbeo and World Economic Forum.\n\nIf you are planning to live in Porto with the intention of working for a Portuguese company fully remote and receiving a €10k bonus every year, your net income after taxes would likely be around €2700 per month. This is still a relatively high salary compared to other European countries, but it may not be enough to cover all your expenses, especially if you plan to live comfortably and travel frequently.\n\nTo calculate the exact amount of money you can expect to have after taxes, you should consult with a financial advisor or use an online income tax calculator that takes into account your personal circumstances and tax bracket in Portugal. Additionally, you may want to consider factors such as housing costs, food expenses, transportation costs, health insurance premiums, child support payments, and any other expenses related to living abroad.\n\nIn terms of cost of living, Portugal has a relatively high cost of living compared to other European countries, with prices for housing, food, transportation, and other goods being significantly higher than in some other countries. However, the cost of living can vary depending on where you live in Portugal and your personal preferences. For example, cities like Porto and Lisbon tend to have a more expensive lifestyle compared to smaller towns or rural areas.\n\nIn summary, while €3570 per month may be enough for some people, it may not be enough for others who plan to live comfortably in Portugal. It's important to consider your personal circumstances and financial goals when deciding whether a salary of this amount is sufficient for your needs."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 71343914145, 'load_duration': 1190995, 'prompt_eval_count': 1548, 'prompt_eval_duration': 5848122000, 'eval_count': 422, 'eval_duration': 65350548000}
