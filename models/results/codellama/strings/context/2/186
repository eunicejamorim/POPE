The FEUP has a long history of producing highly qualified engineers who go on to work in a variety of fields, from energy to biotechnology.\nOne of the most recent projects developed by FEUP is a bread product that uses seaweed as a bioactive ingredient to promote muscle growth and recovery. The project, titled "BodyBoost," was led by researchers Marta Campos Ferreira and Ana Sofia Teixeira.\nAnother notable project from FEUP is "UPWIND," a portable, quick-to-install generator that can produce electricity based on renewable wind energy. This project was developed by a team of four researchers from the SYSTEC department at FEUP.\nOverall, FEUP has produced several innovative projects and research initiatives in recent years that have contributed to making it one of the top engineering schools in Portugal.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 42257987025, 'load_duration': 4199192, 'prompt_eval_count': 1611, 'prompt_eval_duration': 6285485000, 'eval_count': 230, 'eval_duration': 35698470000}
