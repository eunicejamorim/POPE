Here is a summary of the main points:\n\n1. The Service: Pinterest is a social media platform designed to allow users to share images and other visual content with others, similar to Instagram or Flickr. Users can create boards that contain pins (short for "pictures"), which are essentially images that can be shared on the platform.\n2. Using Pinterest: By using Pinterest, you agree to follow these terms and conditions and abide by the site\'s policies, including those related to intellectual property rights, user content, security, third-party links and services, termination, indemnity, disclaimers, limitation of liability, arbitration, governing law and jurisdiction.\n3. Your User Content: You retain ownership of any content you upload or post on Pinterest, but by using the site, you agree to license such content under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 2.5 Generic (CC BY-NC 2.5) license. This means that others may use and distribute your content, but they must give attribution and cannot use it for commercial purposes.\n4. Intellectual Property: Pinterest owns the intellectual property rights to the content on its platform, including any images or other visual elements you create and upload. You are allowed to use these elements in accordance with the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 2.5 Generic (CC BY-NC 2.5) license, but you may not sell or otherwise monetize them without Pinterest\'s prior written consent.\n5. Security: You agree to keep your password and other login information confidential and secure at all times. If you suspect unauthorized access to your account, you should immediately notify Pinterest in writing.\n6. Third-party links, sites, and services: By linking to or using third-party content on the platform, you acknowledge that you are not responsible for its legality or compliance with these terms.\n7. Termination: You may terminate your account at any time by contacting Pinterest\'s customer support team. You also have the right to request that Pinterest remove any content that infringes on your intellectual property rights.\n8. Indemnity: You agree to defend and indemnify Pinterest against any claims or damages arising from your use of the platform, including any loss or damage related to unauthorized access or use of your account.\n9. Disclaimers: Some content on the platform may contain inaccuracies or outdated information. You acknowledge that Pinterest has no responsibility for such content and you should not rely on it for any purpose.\n10. Limitation of Liability: In no event will Pinterest be liable for any damages, including, but not limited to direct, indirect, incidental, consequential or punitive damages. This limitation applies to all damages arising from the use of the platform and regardless of whether Pinterest was advised of the possibility of such damages.\n11. Arbitration: Any disputes arising out of or related to your use of the platform will be resolved through binding arbitration, except in cases where the laws of a particular jurisdiction do not permit arbitration (such as fraud or breach of contract claims). In no event will Pinterest seek injunctive relief or punitive damages.\n12. Governing law and jurisdiction: These terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state where you reside, excluding any conflicts that may arise under state law or federal law governing issues related to the formation of contracts (such as the choice of law provisions).\n13. General terms: You acknowledge that Pinterest has the right to modify these terms at any time without notice and that your continued use of the platform constitutes your acceptance of any such changes. These terms shall apply to all users of the platform, regardless of whether they have registered for an account or not.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 157570576485, 'load_duration': 1627589, 'prompt_eval_count': 1869, 'prompt_eval_duration': 7160810000, 'eval_count': 911, 'eval_duration': 150295511000}
