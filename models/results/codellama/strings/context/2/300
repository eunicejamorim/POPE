However, I can suggest some general guidelines for how to handle sensitive information on the internet.\n\nFirstly, it's important to note that the internet is not inherently insecure, but rather it's up to individuals to take appropriate measures to protect their personal information. Here are some tips that may help:\n\n1. Use strong and unique passwords for all accounts, including social media and email.\n2. Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) where possible to add an extra layer of security.\n3. Avoid using public computers or networks to access sensitive information.\n4. Keep your computer and antivirus software up to date with the latest security patches and updates.\n5. Be cautious when clicking on links or downloading attachments from unknown sources, as they may contain malware or phishing scams.\n6. Monitor your accounts regularly for any suspicious activity, such as unfamiliar charges or login attempts.\n7. Use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks to encrypt your internet traffic.\n8. Use a password manager to generate and store unique, complex passwords for all of your accounts.\n9. Regularly review your privacy settings on social media platforms and other online accounts to ensure they are set to the most restrictive level possible.\n10. Consider using a browser extension or add-on that can help protect you from online threats, such as anti-phishing or anti-malware tools.\n\nIt's important to remember that no single measure is foolproof, and it's always a good idea to be vigilant and aware of your surroundings when using the internet."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 71221320062, 'load_duration': 1458609, 'prompt_eval_count': 2038, 'prompt_eval_duration': 7861794000, 'eval_count': 381, 'eval_duration': 63245925000}
