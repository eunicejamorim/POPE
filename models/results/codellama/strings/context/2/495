The book provides an overview of the basic principles of acoustics and audio engineering, as well as recent advances in these fields, including source-signature analysis, sound-path analysis, envelope and phase analysis, and machine learning techniques for solving acoustical problems.\nThe book is written in a clear and concise manner, making it accessible to readers with a background in physics or engineering but not necessarily in audio engineering. The text is well-structured, with each chapter focusing on a specific aspect of the field, such as linear system theory in the time and frequency domains, source-signature analysis, and machine learning techniques for sound processing.\nOne of the unique features of the book is its emphasis on the subjective experience of sound. The authors provide a seamless and intuitive understanding of the mathematical expressions that underlie the behavior of sound waves, making it easy for readers to visualize and understand the complex processes involved in hearing and sound production.\nThe book covers various topics such as the basics of acoustics and audio engineering, signal processing techniques for sound reproduction and manipulation, and recent advances in machine learning techniques for solving acoustical problems. It also discusses the psychophysics of sound perception and the effects of noise and interference on human hearing.\nThe book is well-organized and easy to follow, with clear and concise explanations of mathematical concepts and practical examples of how these concepts are applied in audio engineering. The authors provide numerous examples and illustrations throughout the book, making it an excellent resource for students, researchers, and professionals in the field of acoustics and audio engineering.\nOverall, "Acoustic Signals and Hearing" is a comprehensive and accessible introduction to the field of acoustics and audio engineering, providing readers with a solid understanding of the basic principles and recent advances in these fields.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 70914568888, 'load_duration': 1072873, 'prompt_eval_count': 1316, 'prompt_eval_duration': 4643919000, 'eval_count': 447, 'eval_duration': 66130433000}
