The IAB has developed guidelines for the use of cookies and other tracking technologies, which can be used to track user behavior across different websites and apps. These guidelines provide a clear definition of what data is being collected, how it's being used, and under what circumstances it may be shared with third parties.\n\nThe IAB's Global Privacy Control allows users to block the use of cookies on websites that they visit, which can limit their access to targeted advertising. The control also allows users to opt out of targeted advertising across multiple platforms at once, making it easier for them to manage their privacy settings and limit the amount of data being collected about them.\n\nThe IAB's Global Privacy Control is not a comprehensive solution for managing personal data, but it does provide some additional protections for users who are concerned about their online privacy. The control allows users to make informed decisions about how much data they want to share with companies and websites, which can help to protect their personal information from being misused or shared without their consent."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 51613752941, 'load_duration': 1511056, 'prompt_eval_count': 1922, 'prompt_eval_duration': 7684830000, 'eval_count': 267, 'eval_duration': 43783087000}
