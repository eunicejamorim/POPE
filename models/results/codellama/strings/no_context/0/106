This means that the vendor can collect and use data related to this purpose even if you have not interacted with the service recently or at all.\n\nFor example, if a website owner has a "remember me" feature on their login page, they can use this purpose to keep track of your browsing history, even if you haven\'t visited the site in a long time. The vendor can use this information to show personalized content or advertising to you across multiple websites and services.\n\nIt is important to note that the "Always Active" label only applies to the specific purpose it is associated with, not to all purposes. For instance, if a website owner has a "remember me" feature on their login page, they may also use other purposes like "storage" or "analysis" to store and analyze your data, even if you have not interacted with the site recently.\n\nOverall, the "Always Active" label means that a vendor can collect and use data related to this purpose whenever it is necessary for the specific activity they are performing, even if you haven\'t interacted with their service in a long time.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 49823209286, 'load_duration': 1287894, 'prompt_eval_count': 1697, 'prompt_eval_duration': 6434837000, 'eval_count': 276, 'eval_duration': 43242755000}
