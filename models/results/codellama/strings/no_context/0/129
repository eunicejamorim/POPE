We also take their rights seriously. Non-Users have the right to access, rectify, port, and erase their information, as well as the right to restrict and object to certain processing of personal information (“ Data Subject Rights ”). This includes the right to object to our processing of their information where we are pursuing our legitimate interests or those of a third party. When assessing an objection from a Non-User, we consider several factors. The first factor is the reasonable expectations of the Non-User. In other words, what do they hope will happen? Is it likely that your request will be met? Is there anything you could do to make it more likely to be met? The second factor is the benefits and risks associated with the processing of their personal information. How might this affect them? What could happen if we refuse their objection? What other options are there? The third factor is whether there are other means to achieve the same purpose that may be less invasive and do not require disproportionate effort. If your request is not met, what would happen next? There are other ways this might be achieved? \nIt’s possible that you may have legitimate reasons for refusing our processing of your information. We will consider all of these factors when assessing an objection from a Non-User. If we do not believe the Non-User has a compelling legitimate interest or reasonable expectations, we will deny their objection and continue to process their personal information unless it is based on compelling legitimate grounds or is needed for legal reasons.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 53233467941, 'load_duration': 1553639, 'prompt_eval_count': 1156, 'prompt_eval_duration': 4156348000, 'eval_count': 348, 'eval_duration': 48936212000}
