However, for the purpose of this calculation, let's assume that you will be living in the Porto area, which is known for its relatively low cost of living compared to other parts of Europe.\n\nTo calculate your net monthly salary after taxes and expenses, you can use the following formula:\n\nNet Monthly Salary = Gross Monthly Salary - Taxes - Health Insurance Premiums - Child Support (if applicable)\n\nGiven that you will be working for a Portuguese company fully remote, it is likely that your employer will cover some or all of your health insurance premiums. However, you may still need to pay for other expenses such as child support if you have children.\n\nAssuming that your gross monthly salary is €3570, your taxes can range from 20% to 38% depending on your income level and any deductions or credits you are eligible for. Let's assume that your tax rate is 30%.\n\nNet Monthly Salary = Gross Monthly Salary - Taxes - Health Insurance Premiums - Child Support (if applicable)\n= €3570 - €1029 - €450 - €500 (assuming a child support payment of €500 per month)\n= €2,020 - €829 - €300 - €500\n\nNet Monthly Salary = €1,201\n\nTherefore, your net monthly salary after taxes and expenses would be €1,201. However, it is important to note that this calculation does not take into account any additional expenses you may incur such as transportation costs or entertainment expenditures."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 78942246648, 'load_duration': 1070983, 'prompt_eval_count': 1725, 'prompt_eval_duration': 6468526000, 'eval_count': 449, 'eval_duration': 72326687000}
