However, I can provide some general information on the cost of living in Portugal and the tax implications of working there.\n\nThe cost of living in Portugal varies depending on the region, with cities like Lisbon and Porto being more expensive than smaller towns and rural areas. On average, a single person living in Portugal would need to budget around €200-€300 per month for essential expenses such as food, housing, and transportation.\n\nIf you are working for a Portuguese company fully remote, your income will not be subject to taxes, as long as it is considered a "freelancer" income. This means that your €50k gross salary would be around €3570 net after tax, assuming no other deductions or contributions are made.\n\nIt\'s worth noting that if you have a child support obligation to another country, you may need to file for Portuguese residence and work in Portugal as a non-EU citizen. This can be a complex process, and there may be additional tax implications and requirements depending on your specific situation.\n\nIn any case, it\'s important to consult with a tax professional or financial advisor to determine the best course of action for your individual circumstances.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 49809878450, 'load_duration': 1294594, 'prompt_eval_count': 1458, 'prompt_eval_duration': 5245864000, 'eval_count': 301, 'eval_duration': 44419406000}
