You have some options to consider when deciding whether to change jobs, such as the potential benefits of working for a different company or the possibility of earning more money. However, it's important to keep in mind that changing jobs can also come with its own set of challenges and risks, such as finding new job opportunities, leaving your current job behind, and adjusting to a new work culture.\n\nIf you are considering changing jobs, it may be helpful to speak with a career counselor or financial advisor to get a better understanding of the potential benefits and drawbacks of making the change. Additionally, you may want to consider factors such as your own personal goals, values, and priorities when deciding whether to make the change.\n\nIn terms of your specific question about gasoline vs. diesel fuel, it is generally recommended to use diesel fuel if you have a diesel engine in your vehicle. Diesel fuel is designed to burn more cleanly and efficiently than gasoline, which can lead to better performance and longer engine life. However, some vehicles may still run on gasoline even if they are equipped with a diesel engine, so it's important to check your vehicle's specifications before making a purchase."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 52948597274, 'load_duration': 1229344, 'prompt_eval_count': 1838, 'prompt_eval_duration': 6935853000, 'eval_count': 282, 'eval_duration': 45868640000}
