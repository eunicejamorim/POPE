This is not allowed on eBay as it is considered spammy and could potentially result in your account being suspended or terminated.\n\nTo fix this issue, you will need to update the listing prices for each motorcycle to reflect their individual values. You can do this by going into the "Price" section of each listing and entering a different price for each item. For example, if you are selling a Triumph Bonneville T100 WABS for €230.50, but your Harley-Davidson VRSC F VROD MUSCLE WABS is actually worth €250, you will need to update the price for that listing to reflect its true value.\n\nAdditionally, you should make sure that each listing has a unique description and photo, as well as clear and concise keywords in the "Keywords" section. This will help buyers quickly find your listings and understand what they are purchasing.\n\nI hope this helps! If you have any other questions or need further assistance, please don\'t hesitate to ask.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 43072836279, 'load_duration': 1202424, 'prompt_eval_count': 1296, 'prompt_eval_duration': 4677169000, 'eval_count': 270, 'eval_duration': 38282379000}
