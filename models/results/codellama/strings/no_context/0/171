The author and their friends went to the arena to see the night show, but when they arrived, they found that the key to their car was nowhere to be found. They tried to contact the restaurant and the Uber driver, but no one could help them find the key. The story takes a humorous turn as the author and their friends searched for the key and eventually found it in an unlikely place. The story ends with the author and their friends returning home, tired but happy from their night out at the arena."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 28823052427, 'load_duration': 1479387, 'prompt_eval_count': 1893, 'prompt_eval_duration': 7228297000, 'eval_count': 132, 'eval_duration': 21479268000}
