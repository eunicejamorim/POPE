The institute has over 56,000 followers on social media and is known for its engagement with young people, especially during National Child Day, which falls on June 20th of each year.\n\nIn this video, the IEFP invited a group of young people to share their thoughts on various topics related to their areas of interest, such as work, studying, and what they want to be when they grow up. The participants were all familiar with the IEFP and its mission, and their responses were shared on the institute's social media channels.\n\nThe video is a great way for young people to express their thoughts and ideas about vocational training and employment in Portugal, and it can also serve as an inspiration to other youth who are interested in pursuing a career in these fields. The IEFP's message of promoting vocational training and employment is important, especially during National Child Day, which highlights the importance of education and job opportunities for young people."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 35279128858, 'load_duration': 5342103, 'prompt_eval_count': 1022, 'prompt_eval_duration': 3473873000, 'eval_count': 246, 'eval_duration': 31539242000}
