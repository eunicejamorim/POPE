The term was first used in 2019 when Disney CEO Bob Iger described the new film "Star Wars: The Mandalorian" as having a character named "Baby Yoda." This led to widespread criticism and backlash, with some fans objecting to the use of the term due to its perceived insensitivity towards the character.\n\nHowever, it\'s worth noting that the term is not meant as an insult or disrespect towards Yoda. Instead, it\'s a playful reference to his iconic status in the Star Wars universe and the fact that he is often depicted as a young, energetic, and wise figure. The use of the term "Baby Yoda" is likely a form of affectionate humor or fan fiction, rather than an attempt at disrespect.\n\nIn conclusion, while the use of the term "Baby Yoda" may have been perceived as insensitive by some fans, it\'s ultimately a harmless reference that has been embraced by many within the Star Wars community.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 52288568208, 'load_duration': 2368758, 'prompt_eval_count': 2011, 'prompt_eval_duration': 7822942000, 'eval_count': 268, 'eval_duration': 44291825000}
