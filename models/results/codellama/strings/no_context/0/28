The training of dentists in this field involves studying and practicing the technique of performing root canal therapy, which includes removing the infected pulp from the tooth, disinfecting the canal, filling it with gutta-perda material, and sealing it with a rubber cap.\n\nThe study of root canal files is an essential part of dental education, as it allows students to learn about the different techniques used in endodontic therapy and the proper techniques for performing root canal procedures. This training includes learning how to perform an impression of the tooth before the procedure, how to create a plan for the treatment, and how to perform the actual procedure itself.\n\nThe use of resin in dental endodontics is another important aspect of the practice model. Resin is a material used to fill the root canal and prevent further infection. It is typically mixed with water and then applied to the tooth using an instrument called a gutta-perda. Once the resin has hardened, it is shaped into a cap that covers the opening of the canal and prevents any bacteria from entering.\n\nThe RCT demo student dentistry teaching is focused on providing students with practical training in endodontic therapy. This includes learning how to perform root canal procedures using a simulated tooth, as well as how to diagnose and treat other conditions that may be present in the mouth.\n\nIn conclusion, the practice model of dental endodontics is focused on treating root canals in teeth through the use of various techniques, including impressioning, plan creation, actual procedure, and resin application. This training is essential for dentists who want to become experts in endodontic therapy and provide high-quality care to their patients.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 68502434679, 'load_duration': 1381706, 'prompt_eval_count': 1593, 'prompt_eval_duration': 5919324000, 'eval_count': 398, 'eval_duration': 62437366000}
