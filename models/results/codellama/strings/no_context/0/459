These principles, known as the "Global Privacy Controls," are designed to ensure that consumers have control over their personal data and how it is used by companies. The Global Privacy Controls aim to provide consumers with more transparency and choice in how their personal data is collected, used, and shared, while also protecting their privacy rights.\n\nThe IAB\'s Global Privacy Controls are intended to help individuals better understand the impact of their online activities on their personal data and ensure that they have control over the information that companies collect about them. The controls aim to promote a more open and transparent approach to advertising and marketing, giving consumers greater choice and control over their personal data.\n\nThe IAB\'s Global Privacy Controls are based on the following principles:\n\n1. Consumers have the right to control their personal data and how it is used by companies.\n2. Companies must provide clear and transparent information about the types of personal data they collect, how they use it, and with whom it may be shared.\n3. Consumers should be able to opt out of having their personal data collected or used for advertising or marketing purposes.\n4. Companies must respect consumers\' right to control their personal data and take steps to protect their privacy rights.\n5. The use of personal data for advertising and marketing purposes should not be the default setting, but rather require the explicit consent of the consumer.\n6. Consumers should have access to a clear and transparent list of all companies that collect, process, or share their personal data.\n7. Companies should provide consumers with the ability to adjust their privacy settings on their devices or online services to control how their personal data is collected, used, and shared.\n8. Consumers should have the right to receive a detailed summary of the types of personal data that companies collect, use, and share, as well as any third parties with whom it may be shared.\n9. Companies should provide consumers with the ability to delete or correct their personal data if it is found to be inaccurate or incomplete.\n10. Consumers should have the right to request that companies stop processing their personal data if they believe it has been collected, used, or shared unlawfully.\n\nThe IAB\'s Global Privacy Controls aim to promote a more open and transparent approach to advertising and marketing, giving consumers greater choice and control over their personal data. By implementing these principles, companies can help consumers better understand the impact of their online activities on their personal data and ensure that they have control over their privacy rights.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 97887466696, 'load_duration': 1163433, 'prompt_eval_count': 1510, 'prompt_eval_duration': 5398959000, 'eval_count': 590, 'eval_duration': 92344342000}
