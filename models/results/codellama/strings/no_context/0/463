This means that data such as an IP address, device capabilities, and other identifying information may be transmitted to and stored by third parties even if the user has not explicitly agreed to do so.\n\nThe "Always Active" label is used in conjunction with the "View Illustrations" and "Measure advertising performance" purposes. When these purposes are combined with the "Always Active" label, it means that data about a user\'s device can be collected and shared even if the user has not explicitly agreed to do so. This is because the "View Illustrations" purpose allows third-party vendors to use data to personalize content and improve products and services, while the "Measure advertising performance" purpose allows third-party vendors to measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns.\n\nIt\'s important to note that even if a user has not explicitly agreed to share their device information with third parties, some websites or apps may still use this data for legitimate purposes, such as improving the user experience or providing targeted advertising. However, it\'s always best to be mindful of your privacy and only share information that you are comfortable with.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 50494986049, 'load_duration': 1198334, 'prompt_eval_count': 1541, 'prompt_eval_duration': 5612817000, 'eval_count': 296, 'eval_duration': 44737852000}
