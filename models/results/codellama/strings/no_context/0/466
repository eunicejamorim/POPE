It uses machine learning algorithms to improve its accuracy and nuance in translation. The company, which was founded by two German computer scientists in 2013, has developed a proprietary neural network-based translation system that is said to be more accurate than existing translators.\n\nDeepL's accuracy has been tested by WIRED magazine, which found that the translations produced by DeepL were often more fluently written and accurately conveyed the meaning of the source text. The test also showed that DeepL was able to recognize languages quickly and automatically, without requiring any statistical pretense.\n\nThe company has also been praised for its ability to produce high-quality translations in various languages, including those with complex grammar rules or idioms. Additionally, DeepL's integration with popular apps such as Microsoft Word and Google Workspace has made it easy for users to access the translation feature without having to leave the application.\n\nDespite its success, DeepL has faced some criticism from some users who have expressed concern about the potential impact of machine learning algorithms on privacy and security. However, the company has implemented various measures to ensure user data privacy and security, including end-to-end encryption and secure servers.\n\nOverall, DeepL is a popular online translator that has shown great promise in producing accurate and nuanced translations. Its integration with popular apps and its focus on machine learning have made it an attractive option for users who want to easily access translation capabilities without having to leave the application."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 64460506521, 'load_duration': 1142483, 'prompt_eval_count': 1822, 'prompt_eval_duration': 6952160000, 'eval_count': 353, 'eval_duration': 57364165000}
