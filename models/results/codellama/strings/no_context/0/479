The ground was pink and colourful umbrellas swung above and it was the sort of atmosphere we had been looking for in Lisbon and had yet to find until now. Barrio Alto and the pink street was our favourite spot and wished we had spent more time here than wasting a day in Alfama.\n* Read more 1 1 1 1\n* Philip F. added 2 photos 6 hours ago\n* Pastéis de Belém\n* 1162 €\n* Inexpensive Bakeries\n* likes 1\n* likes 1\n* Philip F. wrote a review 6 hours ago\n* Pastéis de Belém\n* The little custard pastries sold in this shop are amazing! If the line is long to get them fresh, you can grab a box to go and they are just as delish. This is a must stop while visiting Lisbon, especially if you are visiting St Jerome Monastery.\n* Read more 1 1 1 1\n* Allie B. added a photo 7 hours ago\n* Augusto Lisboa\n* 62 €\n* Moderate Cafes\n* likes 1\n* Allie B. wrote a review 7 hours ago\n* Augusto Lisboa\n* Great food, waited in line for a while, worth the wait! We had the brunch and the portion size was very big we had a lot of leftovers. Avocado toast was our favorite!\n* Read more 1 1 1 1\n* Casey M. wrote a review 20 hours ago\n* Estação do Cais do Sodré\n* It is from here you get the train to Cascais and the whole process was quick and easy from buying tickets to getting to the platform to boarding. It's a small station and has toilets and a coffee shop.\n* Read more 1 1 1 1\n* Should this page be private to a certain user?
