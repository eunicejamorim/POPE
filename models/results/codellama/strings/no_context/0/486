The business was a local flower shop, and I was impressed by the quality of their flowers and the helpful staff. They had a wide variety of colors and types available, and the staff was friendly and knowledgeable about the different varieties. I also appreciated that they offered a rewards program for customers who made repeat visits to the shop.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this business to others and plan to return in the future. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the flowers were of high quality. The only drawback was that the shop did not have a lot of reviews on Yelp, so it may be worth checking out their website or social media pages for more information before visiting.\n\nI would rate this business 4.5 stars out of 5. Overall, I am happy with my experience at this flower shop and would recommend it to others.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 21351352156, 'load_duration': 1124504, 'prompt_eval_count': 333, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1090610000, 'eval_count': 200, 'eval_duration': 20129870000}
