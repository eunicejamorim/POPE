The book covers a wide range of topics, from the basics of acoustics and audio engineering to more advanced concepts such as source-signature and sound-path analysis.\n\nOne of the key features of the book is its focus on the perspective of hearing. Tohyama presents unique sounds and sound fields from the perspective of hearing, which allows readers to gain a deeper understanding of how sound interacts with the human auditory system. The book also covers source-signature and sound-path analysis, which are important concepts for engineers and scientists working in the field of acoustics.\n\nAnother key feature of the book is its use of new envelope and phase analysis approaches to signal and waveform analysis. These approaches provide readers with new perspectives on how to solve acoustical problems and allow them to better understand the properties of sound waves.\n\nThe book also provides a seamless and intuitive understanding of mathematical expressions and their relationship to subjective impressions of sound. This makes it an excellent resource for anyone looking to develop a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles of sound and its relationship to human perception.\n\nOverall, "Acoustics and Audio Engineering" is an excellent book that provides readers with a comprehensive overview of the field of acoustics and audio engineering. It covers a wide range of topics, from the basics of acoustics and audio engineering to more advanced concepts, and provides readers with a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles of sound and its relationship to human perception.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 54247292629, 'load_duration': 1125533, 'prompt_eval_count': 1215, 'prompt_eval_duration': 4213745000, 'eval_count': 360, 'eval_duration': 49892678000}
