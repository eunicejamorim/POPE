He wanted to create a platform where people could come and find answers to their questions in one place, without having to search through multiple websites or books.\n\nTo achieve this mission, Herrick refused venture capital funding and opportunities to sell the company to larger publicly traded corporations. Instead, he focused on creating a hybrid organization that would remain financially stable while also achieving his socially positive mission.\n\nToday, wikiHow is headquartered in Palo Alto, California and maintains remote offices around the world. The company's mission is to provide a platform where people can find step-by-step instructions for solving every problem they might encounter, all in one place. To achieve this, wikiHow has created an open source software that allows anyone to contribute to its content, making it a self-sustaining platform.\n\nIn addition to providing answers to questions, wikiHow also supports itself financially through advertising and sponsorships. The company has been recognized as a Small Giant by Forbes in 2019 for its dedication to greatness, growth, and people over profit.\n\nwikiHow has made a significant impact on the world by providing step-by-step instructions that have helped millions of people around the globe. The platform's content is available in multiple languages and has been translated into many different formats, making it accessible to people all over the world.\n\nIn addition to its impact on people's lives, wikiHow has also made a significant contribution to society through its mission to provide free and open access to information. The company's commitment to this mission has helped to democratize access to knowledge and make it more equitable for everyone.\n\nOverall, wikiHow is an example of a company that is dedicated to achieving greatness while also prioritizing the well-being of people over profits. Its open source software and commitment to providing free and open access to information have helped to make it a leader in its field and a positive force for change in the world."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 75837095643, 'load_duration': 1789272, 'prompt_eval_count': 1402, 'prompt_eval_duration': 4858558000, 'eval_count': 476, 'eval_duration': 70863577000}
