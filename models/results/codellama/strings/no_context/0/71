The replacement card, called the "Amazon Card," has a higher annual fee and lower interest rates than the LBB Karte, as well as other limitations and issues that have been reported by users. However, it is also worth noting that the Amazon Card has its own unique features and benefits, such as the ability to earn bonus points through purchases on Amazon and its partners, which can be redeemed for loot in the form of discounts or free items.\n\nThe lack of availability of the LBB Karte is a disappointment for many users who were excited about its potential benefits. However, it is also understandable that Amazon may not want to offer the card any longer due to changes in customer preferences and market conditions. The company has been known to regularly update and modify their products and services in response to changing customer needs and trends, and this is likely why the LBB Karte is no longer being offered.\n\nFor those who are still interested in using a credit card with Amazon benefits, it may be worth considering other options that have similar features and benefits, such as the "Amazon Card" or other cards that offer similar perks and discounts. It is also important to carefully review any new credit card or rewards program before committing to it, in order to ensure that it meets your needs and expectations.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 45667669741, 'load_duration': 1579950, 'prompt_eval_count': 1105, 'prompt_eval_duration': 3957671000, 'eval_count': 313, 'eval_duration': 41587461000}
