Additionally, users can use any payment method supported by the App Store or Google Play on mobile apps. \n* Can I pay with cryptocurrency? You can only pay with cryptocurrencies (such as BTC, ETH, USDC, USDT, BCH, LTC, DOGE, DAI, Matic) for annual plans. Coinbase handles payment processing for TradingView. To use cryptocurrency to make a purchase, you must enable the "Crypto" tab on the Order page and follow the instructions.\n* Can I cancel at any time? You can cancel your subscription anytime, and it will not automatically renew after the paid term. \n* A canceled trial will stop immediately after cancellation. Your paid service will remain active for the duration of the paid term.\n* Refund Policy: There are no refunds for initial purchases (first-time payments), and there are no refunds for monthly plans. Refunds are available only after an automatic deduction for annual payments (i.e., after a trial or renewal) within 14 calendar days after the payment was made.\n* How does upgrading without payment work? You can upgrade your annual subscription at any time with no extra transactions needed. All remaining days of your current plan will be automatically converted into equivalent value days on the new tier. You don\'t lose anything, just use the remaining amount to switch to a better version. Thus, the remaining period of your subscription will be reduced and your next payment date will be switched.\n* How does downgrading work? If you downgrade, your current plan will stay exactly as it is until its subscription date. Then, once it expires, your new downgraded plan will go live at the selected rate. \n* What are extra real-time data options? All extra real-time and intraday data for exchanges — NASDAQ, NYSE, NYSE ARCA, OTC, CME, etc. — can be added separately to your account. To add data, you must first have one of their paid plans or trial members. See all the global data available to you. \n* Will extra real-time data also work on TradingView widgets? No. Extra real-time data is only available on the TradingView website and only for users who purchased the data from eligible exchanges with their paid TradingView account. What is the difference between a professional plan and non-professional subscription plans? \n* "Professional" usage relates to common business activities where market data is used on behalf of businesses or entities, funds or asset managers. "Non-Professional" usage refers to market data for personal use only. This means that any person who uses market data as a retail customer or market hobbyist is a Non-professional user while those who use market data on behalf of an employer or engages in the trading between businesses or entities, is considered to be a Professional user. \n* Can I still buy a professional plan if I\'m not a professional trader? Yes, sure! Our professional plans have plenty of features, including more alerts, data, multiple charts, and more. If you need more than the non-professional plan provides, you can purchase any of the professional plans, even if you are not a professional trader. \n* Enterprise Plan: TradingView has an enterprise plan that offers advanced features such as custom charts, real-time data, and secure file sharing. The enterprise plan is ideal for large businesses or organizations with multiple users who need access to advanced charting tools and real-time data.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 136969753523, 'load_duration': 1439257, 'prompt_eval_count': 1225, 'prompt_eval_duration': 4398137000, 'eval_count': 877, 'eval_duration': 132432133000}
