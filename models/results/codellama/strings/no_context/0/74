The platform offers several subscription plans, including non-professional and professional subscriptions, which differ in terms of the features and data available to users. Here are some answers to frequently asked questions about TradingView subscriptions:\n\nIs it safe to buy subscriptions on TradingView?\nYes, TradingView uses secure payment methods such as credit cards, PayPal, Apple Pay, and cryptocurrencies like BTC, ETH, USDC, USDT, BCH, LTC, DOGE, DAI, Matic. Coinbase handles payment processing for TradingView.\n\nHow can I pay for a TradingView subscription?\nAcceptable payment methods include all major credit cards, PayPal accounts, Apple Pay, and cryptocurrencies. Additionally, on the mobile apps, you can use any payment method supported by the App Store or Google Play.\n\nCan I pay with crypto?\nYes, you can pay with crypto (BTC, ETH, USDC, USDT, BCH, LTC, DOGE, DAI, Matic) for annual plans only. Coinbase handles payment processing for TradingView. To pay with crypto, switch on the "Crypto" tab on the Order page and follow the instructions.\n\nCan I cancel anytime?\nYes, you can cancel your subscription at any time and it will not auto-renew after the current paid term. Paid service will remain active for the duration of the paid term. A canceled trial will stop immediately after cancellation.\n\nWhat is your Refund Policy?\nThere are no refunds for initial orders (i.e. first-time purchases) and there are no refunds for monthly plans. Refunds are available only after an automatic deduction for annual payments (i.e. after trial and after renewal) within 14 calendar days after the payment was made.\n\nHow does upgrading without payment work?\nYou can upgrade your annual subscription at any time with no extra transactions needed. All remaining days of your current plan will be automatically converted into equivalent value days on the new tier. You don\'t lose anything, just use the remaining amount to switch to a better version. Thus, the remaining period of your subscription will be reduced and your next payment date will be switched.\n\nHow does downgrading work?\nIf you downgrade, your current plan will stay exactly as it is until its subscription date. Then, once it expires, your new downgraded plan will go live at the selected rate.\n\nHow can I get extra real-time data?\nAll extra real-time and intraday data for exchanges — NASDAQ, NYSE, NYSE ARCA, OTC, CME, etc. — are available to be added separately to your account. To add data, you first need to have one of our paid plans or to be a trial member. Take a look at all the global data available to you.\n\nWill extra real-time data also work on TradingView widgets?\nNo. Extra real-time data is only available on the TradingView website and only for users who purchased the data from eligible exchanges with their paid TradingView account.\n\nWhat is the difference between professional and non-professional subscriptions?\nIn general, "Professional" usage relates to common business activity where market data is used on behalf of businesses or entities, funds or asset managers. "Non-Professional" usage refers to market data for personal use only.
