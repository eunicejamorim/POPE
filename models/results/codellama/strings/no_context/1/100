The reason is that the Bing Webmaster Portal requires users to have an account before they can access certain features and customize widgets.\n\nHowever, I can offer some general advice on how to approach this issue. If you're looking to add a Bing Maps widget to your website without requiring users to log in, you may want to consider the following options:\n\n1. Use a third-party service that allows you to embed a Bing Maps widget without requiring users to log in. There are several services available that offer this functionality, such as Google Maps or Mapbox.\n2. Use a custom URL that redirects users to the Bing Webmaster Portal login page before allowing them to access the widget. This can be done by creating a custom URL that contains a query parameter with the Bing Maps API key and then redirecting users to the login page before allowing them to access the widget.\n3. Use a different method of authentication that doesn't require users to log in, such as using an API key or other authorization token. This would allow you to embed the widget on your website without requiring users to log in.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 51104868772, 'load_duration': 1216695, 'prompt_eval_count': 1541, 'prompt_eval_duration': 5599710000, 'eval_count': 297, 'eval_duration': 45359191000}
