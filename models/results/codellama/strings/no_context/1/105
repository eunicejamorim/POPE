Actively scan device characteristics for identification: This purpose allows IAB vendors to request and use certain characteristics specific to your device, such as the installed fonts or plugins, the resolution of your screen, in order to distinguish it from other devices.\n4. Ensure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors: This purpose allows IAB vendors to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity related to advertising or content delivery, as well as ensure that systems and processes work properly and securely.
