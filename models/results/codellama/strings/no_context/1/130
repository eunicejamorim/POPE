The plan provides additional features and benefits such as access to higher-resolution profile photos, improved messaging and storytelling tools, and increased visibility in search results.\n\nTo access the Meta Verified Standard plan, users must meet certain eligibility requirements, which include being 18 years or older and having a verified account on Instagram or Facebook. Once they have met these requirements, they can apply for a subscription through their personal or creator account on Instagram or Facebook.\n\nThe verification process involves providing government-issued ID and, in some regions, submitting a selfie video to confirm the user's identity. The Meta Verified Standard plan is available to both creators and businesses, with the latter needing additional verification such as verifying their business details.\n\nThe cost of the subscription varies depending on the region and whether it is purchased from within the app or through the web. Users can also link their Instagram and Facebook accounts in Account Center to take advantage of a discounted price for subscribing to two profiles at once."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 39689385184, 'load_duration': 1262225, 'prompt_eval_count': 1133, 'prompt_eval_duration': 3960489000, 'eval_count': 268, 'eval_duration': 35589689000}
