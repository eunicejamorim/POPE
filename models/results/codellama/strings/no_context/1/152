The following are some examples of the types of data that can be found in this format:\n\n* Usernames and passwords: These are stored as plaintext, which means anyone who has access to the HTML file can view them. This is not secure and should be avoided.\n* Email addresses: Similar to usernames and passwords, email addresses can also be found in plaintext. While they may not contain sensitive information like passwords, they could still potentially be used for spamming or other malicious activities.\n* IP addresses: These are stored as plaintext and can be used to identify the location of a user accessing the webpage. This information can be useful for tracking website visitors but should be handled with caution.\n* User preferences: In some cases, websites may store user preferences in HTML files, such as language settings or other personalization options. These preferences are typically stored in plaintext and could potentially be viewed by unauthorized users.\n* Sensitive data: While not explicitly stated in the text you provided, it's possible that sensitive information such as credit card numbers or personally identifiable information may also be present in HTML files. This type of data should be handled with extreme caution and encrypted to prevent unauthorized access.\n\nOverall, it's important to be mindful of the types of data stored in HTML files and to take steps to protect sensitive information from being accessed by unauthorized users."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 43676820045, 'load_duration': 1206374, 'prompt_eval_count': 910, 'prompt_eval_duration': 3106668000, 'eval_count': 322, 'eval_duration': 40438213000}
