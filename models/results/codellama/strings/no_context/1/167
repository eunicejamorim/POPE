However, I can provide some general information that might help you make an informed decision.\n\nFirstly, it's important to note that the cost of living in Portugal can be relatively high compared to other European countries, particularly if you are a single person without any family ties or benefits package. According to various sources, the cost of living in Porto is estimated to be around 10% higher than in Lisbon, which is the largest city and capital of Portugal.\n\nRegarding your question about tax deductions for child support payments made while living overseas, there may be some tax benefits available depending on your individual circumstances. For example, if you are a Portuguese citizen or resident, you may be eligible for certain tax allowances or deductions related to your income from abroad. However, these rules and regulations can be complex and subject to change, so it's best to consult with a tax professional or financial advisor to get the most up-to-date information.\n\nIn terms of your overall budget, €3570 per month should be sufficient for a single person living in Portugal, assuming you are able to save some money and manage your expenses effectively. However, if you are not saving enough, you may find that you need to make some adjustments to your lifestyle or income sources to ensure that you have enough funds to cover your costs of living.\n\nIt's also worth considering the potential benefits of moving to Portugal, such as the country's rich history and culture, beautiful landscapes, and vibrant cities. Depending on your interests and priorities, you may find that living in Portugal is a great opportunity for personal and professional growth, or it may be a more expensive choice than you expected. Ultimately, the decision to move to Portugal (or any other country) should be based on careful consideration of your individual circumstances and financial goals."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 70142855093, 'load_duration': 1196614, 'prompt_eval_count': 1457, 'prompt_eval_duration': 5298726000, 'eval_count': 429, 'eval_duration': 64700505000}
