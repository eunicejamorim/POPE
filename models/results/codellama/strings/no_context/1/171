She and her sister were there for a concert and ended up losing their keys during the performance. They tried to contact the restaurant and Uber but couldn't get any answers. In the end, they had to accept that it was the law of Murphy and call their husband to come and bring them home.\n\nHowever, things took an unexpected turn when they found out that the backup key they had been using for years had run out of power and wouldn't work. They were stuck in the parking lot with no way to start their car. But then, Nuno's wife had an idea and suggested blowing some warm air on the pilota to give it a fresh start. To everyone's surprise, it worked! The car started and they were able to continue their journey home.\n\nThe story has a happy ending but also serves as a reminder that sometimes unexpected events can happen even when we have everything planned out perfectly."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 44374524407, 'load_duration': 1779711, 'prompt_eval_count': 1892, 'prompt_eval_duration': 7207072000, 'eval_count': 227, 'eval_duration': 37051501000}
