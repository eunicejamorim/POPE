Tyson is considered one of the best boxers of all time, and he has been inactive for over 20 years. He would need to train extensively to prepare for the fight and recover from any injuries that may arise during training.\nIt's also worth noting that Tyson has a reputation for being a tough opponent to defeat, and many experts believe that he could potentially be too much for Jordan to handle in a fight. Additionally, there would need to be a clear understanding of the rules and regulations surrounding fights between former champions, as well as any legal considerations that would need to be taken into account.\nOverall, while it is possible that Michael Jordan could have a successful comeback against Mike Tyson, it would likely require a lot of planning, hard work, and dedication from both parties involved."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 35011552264, 'load_duration': 1502938, 'prompt_eval_count': 1324, 'prompt_eval_duration': 4648285000, 'eval_count': 216, 'eval_duration': 30212633000}
