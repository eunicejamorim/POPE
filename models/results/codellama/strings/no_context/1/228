It is a remnant of the Old English language and was used in Middle English to indicate that two words or phrases are grammatically parallel. In modern English, we would simply use the word "is" instead of "ise."\n\nFor example: "Likewise, in the same series, the Bowery King is played by Laurence Fishburne (Who plays Morpheus). When he is first introduced he says \'Mr. Wick doesn\'t remember but we met many years ago before my ascension, when I was just a pawn in the game. We met and you gave me a gift," which is similar to how Neo and Morpheus were in the Matrix."\n\nIn this context, "likewise" means that the same thing happens in both series. The word "in the same series" refers to the fact that both the Bowery King and Morpheus are characters in the Matrix movie series.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 36480236494, 'load_duration': 2238987, 'prompt_eval_count': 1098, 'prompt_eval_duration': 4005723000, 'eval_count': 249, 'eval_duration': 32318819000}
