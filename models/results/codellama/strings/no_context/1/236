Lack of marketing: The movie was released in a relatively small number of theaters and did not receive the same level of marketing as other movies like "The Secret Life of Pets 2" or "Despicable Me 3". This may have contributed to lower box office revenue compared to those movies.\n2. Competition from other family-friendly films: The movie was released around the same time as other family-friendly films like "The Emoji Movie" and "The Boss Baby", which may have cannibalized some of its potential audience.\n3. Limited appeal for younger audiences: While the movie is marketed towards parents with young children, it may not have been appealing to younger viewers who were more interested in other family-friendly movies.\n4. Lack of a clear narrative structure: The movie\'s story was relatively straightforward and may not have provided enough opportunities for audiences to engage with the characters and themes in a way that would encourage repeat viewings or discussion among friends and family.\n5. Limited appeal for older audiences: While the movie\'s animation style is impressive, it may not have been appealing to older viewers who were looking for something more sophisticated or complex.\n6. Lack of a clear message: The movie does not deliver a clear message or theme that would resonate with a wide range of audiences. While the characters are adorable and relatable, the story is relatively straightforward and may not have provided enough depth or complexity to keep viewers engaged.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 67457015396, 'load_duration': 1348316, 'prompt_eval_count': 1884, 'prompt_eval_duration': 7149115000, 'eval_count': 368, 'eval_duration': 60157792000}
