It typically includes information about what types of data will be collected, how it will be used, and with whom it will be shared.\n\nOn the other hand, a privacy policy is a document that outlines an organization's practices related to protecting the privacy of its customers or users. It explains how personal data is collected, stored, processed, and disclosed, as well as the measures taken to ensure the security and confidentiality of such data.\n\nWhile both consent forms and privacy policies are important for protecting individuals' privacy rights, they serve different purposes. A consent form is used to obtain consent from an individual before collecting their personal data, while a privacy policy is used to explain how an organization will handle any personal data it collects.\n\nIt's worth noting that while a privacy policy may be required by law or regulation, a consent form is typically optional and may only be necessary in cases where the individual has provided their consent for the collection of their personal data."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 43848074152, 'load_duration': 1356346, 'prompt_eval_count': 1465, 'prompt_eval_duration': 5261482000, 'eval_count': 262, 'eval_duration': 38440144000}
