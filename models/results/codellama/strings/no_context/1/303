In 2020, for example, the American firm Dorilton Capital paid $180 million for Williams, while Lawrence Stroll, a Canadian billionaire, paid $117 million for Force India in 2018. This year, a group of investors, including one involving the actor Ryan Reynolds, bought a 24% stake in Renault-owned Alpine for around $218 million, valuing the team at about $900 million.\nOne factor that has contributed to the increased value of Formula 1 teams is their ability to generate revenue through sponsorship deals. Teams can earn significant amounts of money from these partnerships, and some teams have been able to increase their revenue by as much as 25% over the past few years. This has allowed teams to invest more in their technology and operations, leading to improved performance on the track.\nAnother factor that has driven up team value is the changing ownership structures of many Formula 1 teams. In recent years, there have been several instances of teams being sold or taken private, which can have a significant impact on their value. For example, in 2020, Liberty Media, a Canadian investment firm, purchased Ferrari for $4 billion, making it one of the most valuable Formula 1 teams in history. This purchase was made possible by the team\'s performance and financial stability, as well as its attractiveness to potential buyers due to its storied history and prestige within the sport.\nThe changing ownership structures of teams has also led to a more diverse pool of investors and stakeholders, which can have a positive impact on the sport overall. In addition to Ferrari, other Formula 1 teams that have recently undergone ownership changes include Haas, Aston Martin, and Alpine.\nThe increased value of Formula 1 teams has also been driven by changing consumer trends and preferences within the sport itself. For example, the Netflix series "Drive to Survive" has been a major factor in the sport\'s recent growth and popularity, as it has helped to attract new fans and increase viewership.\nAs the sport continues to evolve and adapt to changing consumer trends, we can expect to see further increases in team value and investment in the future.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 88690776936, 'load_duration': 1770372, 'prompt_eval_count': 1538, 'prompt_eval_duration': 5572569000, 'eval_count': 531, 'eval_duration': 83006834000}
