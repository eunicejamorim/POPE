However, he has also continued to produce music that appeals to a new generation of listeners, and his last two albums have exceeded three billion streams on Spotify. Despite this, Eminem has still faced controversy, including the use of homophobic language against Tyler, the Creator, which led to an apology from him. This highlights the evolving public opinion in today\'s online cancel culture, with older audiences viewing it as censoring artistic freedom and younger people seeing it as essential for accountability.\n\nIn recent years, Eminem has also made a conscious effort to distance himself from Trump supporters, both through his music and public statements. His new album, "Hell\'s Kitchen," features a number of politically charged tracks that are critical of the current political climate, including the single "Dear Slim Shady." While some have praised this move as an effort to secure his legacy, others have called for him to be cancelled due to his controversial lyrics.\n\nOverall, Eminem\'s response to online criticism has been complex and multifaceted, reflecting the evolving public opinion in today\'s online cancel culture. While some younger audiences may view his attempts at political engagement as censorship, others see it as an important step towards accountability and social change.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 52720740598, 'load_duration': 1195404, 'prompt_eval_count': 1369, 'prompt_eval_duration': 4822753000, 'eval_count': 328, 'eval_duration': 47754608000}
