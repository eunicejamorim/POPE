The platform was created in 2016 by Luke Kidgell, a comedian who wanted to make it easier for creators to promote their work on various social media platforms. Since its launch, Linktree has become popular among content creators and small businesses that want to showcase their work without having multiple profiles.\n\nLinktree offers a range of features that make it easy for users to customize their profiles and connect with others. For example, users can add subheadings, sections, animation, and other prioritization methods to their links to make sure that they are driving traffic to the most important content on their website or blog. Users can also use Linktree's analytics tools to quickly and easily discover where their visitors are coming from and what they are clicking on.\n\nOne of the key benefits of using Linktree is that it allows users to create a unique link for each platform they want to promote, making it easy for them to connect with others who are also interested in the same platforms. Additionally, Linktree's algorithm prioritizes the most popular and relevant links, which helps to ensure that visitors will be directed to the content that is most likely to be of interest to them.\n\nOverall, Linktree is a useful tool for anyone who wants to promote their work on multiple social media platforms without having to create multiple profiles. Its ease of use, customization options, and analytics tools make it a great choice for small businesses and content creators looking to build their online presence."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 65408390234, 'load_duration': 1336706, 'prompt_eval_count': 1968, 'prompt_eval_duration': 7684567000, 'eval_count': 349, 'eval_duration': 57578263000}
