However, I can offer some general tips that may help you make an informed decision:\n\n1. Determine your workout type and intensity: Consider the type of workouts you do regularly and how intense they are. For example, if you engage in high-impact activities like running or weightlifting, you may need a sports bra with more supportive features, such as extra padding and a stretchy design.

Consider your lifestyle: The frequency of your workouts and your overall lifestyle can impact how well a sports bra lasts. If you engage in high-intensity exercise regularly, you may need a more durable and comfortable sports bra that can withstand sweat and moisture. On the other hand, if you have a sedentary lifestyle and don't work out frequently, a less expensive, breathable sports bra may be more suitable for your needs.\n4. Evaluate the features: Look for sports bras with additional features that can enhance your comfort and support. Some popular features include:\n* Side packing: This feature helps to maintain the shape of your breasts during workouts.\n* Adjustable straps: Adjustable straps allow you to customize the fit of your sports bra, making it more comfortable and secure.\n* Breathable materials: Look for sports bras made with breathable materials like cotton, polyester, or blends that can help keep you cool during workouts.\n5. Check the care label: Make sure to choose a sports bra with a good care label that outlines how to wash and maintain the garment. This can help ensure that your sports bra lasts longer and doesn't wear out quickly.\n\nOverall, choosing the best sports bra for your needs requires some research and evaluation. By considering your workout type, body type, lifestyle, features, and care label, you can find a sports bra that meets your comfort and support needs."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 101470656159, 'load_duration': 1147234, 'prompt_eval_count': 1905, 'prompt_eval_duration': 7152345000, 'eval_count': 568, 'eval_duration': 94173379000}
