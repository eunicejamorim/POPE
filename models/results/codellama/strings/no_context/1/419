To properly dispose of these items, it is important to follow the guidelines set by your local government and waste management agencies. In the United States, for example, you can find information on how to recycle plastic containers in your state's official website or through the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\nIn general, plastic containers should be placed in a designated recycling bin with other plastics and paper products. It is important to remove any labels or caps before placing them in the recycling bin to prevent contamination of other materials. Additionally, make sure that the container is completely empty before disposing of it to ensure that all liquid balms are properly recycled.\nIf you are unsure about how to properly dispose of plastic containers, you can contact your local waste management agency or the EPA for more information."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 31760887288, 'load_duration': 1027642, 'prompt_eval_count': 1173, 'prompt_eval_duration': 4157252000, 'eval_count': 208, 'eval_duration': 27461047000}
