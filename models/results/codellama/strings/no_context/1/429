Wikipedia's purpose is to benefit society by providing accurate and reliable information on any topic, in any language, without the need for commercial advertisements. The platform was founded in 2001 by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, and it has since become one of the most widely used websites in the world, with over 34 million articles written by more than 57 million registered users.\n\nOne of the key features that makes Wikipedia so successful is its openness to anyone who wants to contribute. This means that anyone can create an article on any topic they choose, and the information is available to anyone who visits the site. This has led to the creation of thousands of articles on a wide range of topics, from science and technology to pop culture and politics.\n\nDespite its openness, Wikipedia operates under strict guidelines that ensure the accuracy and reliability of the information it provides. These guidelines are enforced by a community of editors who review each article before it is published, making sure that any content added to the site meets certain standards for quality and relevance.\n\nIn addition to its extensive collection of articles, Wikipedia also includes a vast array of multimedia content, including images, videos, audio files, and interactive features. This makes it possible for users to explore topics in greater detail than ever before, and to learn about new concepts and ideas in a more engaging and interactive way.\n\nOverall, Wikipedia is a powerful tool that has revolutionized the way we think about knowledge and information. It provides access to vast amounts of information on any topic, all free of charge, and it encourages collaboration among users who want to contribute their own unique perspectives and ideas. Whether you are a student looking for help with an assignment or a professional seeking information for your work, Wikipedia is an invaluable resource that can provide you with the knowledge and expertise you need to succeed."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 76472432074, 'load_duration': 1336356, 'prompt_eval_count': 2018, 'prompt_eval_duration': 7776039000, 'eval_count': 418, 'eval_duration': 68552539000}
