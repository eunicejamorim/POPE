The Act requires companies to get consent from California residents before collecting, selling, or sharing their personal information.\n\nUnder the CCPA, companies must follow a specific process for obtaining and managing consumer consent. This includes providing clear and concise notice of how personal information will be used, allowing consumers to opt-out at any time, and taking reasonable steps to verify that consent has been obtained.\n\nThe Act also requires companies to provide an easy-to-understand way for consumers to exercise their right to opt-out of targeted advertising and other practices. This includes providing a clear and conspicuous link or button on websites where consumers can easily disable targeted advertising, as well as providing a way for consumers to block third-party cookies through their browser settings.\n\nIn addition, the CCPA requires companies to disclose how they collect, sell, and share personal information with third parties. This includes disclosing whether any personal information has been sold or shared with third parties, and providing a clear and conspicuous link or button on websites where consumers can easily view or delete their personal information from these third-party data brokers.\n\nOverall, the CCPA is designed to give California consumers more control over how their personal information is used by businesses, including advertisers and data brokers. By implementing the Act, companies can demonstrate their commitment to transparency and privacy, while also ensuring that they are able to use personal information in a responsible and ethical manner.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 62463612050, 'load_duration': 1020172, 'prompt_eval_count': 1564, 'prompt_eval_duration': 6244068000, 'eval_count': 363, 'eval_duration': 56076237000}
