The book covers various aspects of processing, including source-signature and sound-path analysis, signal and waveform analysis, and phase properties on ways to solve acoustical problems.\nThe book provides a seamless and intuitive understanding of the mathematical formulations underlying processing, from familiar discrete expressions of sound waves to a subjective impression of sound. It also presents unique sounds and sound fields from the perspective of hearing and covers source-signature and sound-path analysis in the context of linear system theory in the time and frequency domains.\nThe book is written in an accessible and engaging style, making it suitable for both experienced audio engineers and those new to the field. It also provides a valuable resource for researchers and students interested in exploring the principles and applications of processing in various fields.\nOverall, "Processing" by Mikio Tohyama is a valuable contribution to the field of audio engineering and sound design, providing insights into the fundamental concepts and techniques underlying this important area of study.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 33419250975, 'load_duration': 1222405, 'prompt_eval_duration': 142899000, 'eval_count': 245, 'eval_duration': 33136494000}
