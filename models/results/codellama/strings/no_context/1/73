Here are some guidelines for each acceptable payment option:\n\n* Acceptable payment methods include major credit cards, PayPal accounts, Apple Pay, and crypto payments.\n* For annual plans only, you can pay with cryptocurrencies such as BTC, ETH, USDC, USDT, BCH, LTC, DOGE, DAI, Matic. Coinbase handles payment processing for TradingView. To pay with crypto, switch on the “Crypto” tab on the Order page and follow instructions.\n* You can cancel your subscription at any time and it will not auto-renew after the current paid term. Paid service will remain active for the duration of the paid term. A canceled trial will stop immediately after cancellation.\n* There are no refunds for initial orders (i.e. first-time purchases) and there are no refunds for monthly plans. Refunds are available only after an automatic deduction for annual payments (i.e. after trial and after renewal) within 14 calendar days after the payment was made.\n* You can upgrade your annual subscription at any time with no extra transactions needed. All remaining days of your current plan will be automatically converted into equivalent value days on the new tier. You don’t lose anything, just use the remaining amount to switch to a better version. Thus, the remaining period of your subscription will be reduced and your next payment date will be switched.\n* If you downgrade, your current plan will stay exactly as it is until its subscription date. Then, once it expires, your new downgraded plan will go live at the selected rate.\n* All extra real-time and intraday data for exchanges — NASDAQ, NYSE, NYSE ARCA, OTC, CME, etc. — are available to be added separately to your account. To add data, you first need to have one of our paid plans or to be a trial member. Take a look at all the global data available to you.\n* Extra real-time data is only available on the TradingView website and only for users who purchased the data from eligible exchanges with their paid TradingView account.\n* The difference between professional and non-professional subscriptions is that “Professional” usage relates to common business activity where market data is used on behalf of businesses or entities, funds or asset managers. “Non-Professional” usage refers to market data for personal use only. This means that any person who uses market data as a retail customer or market hobbyist is a Non-professional user while those who use market data on behalf of an employer or engages in the trading between businesses or entities, is considered to be a Professional user.\n* You can still buy a professional plan if you’re not a professional trader. Our professional plans have plenty of features, including more alerts, data, multiple charts, and more. If you need more than non-professional plans provide, you can purchase any of the professional ones, even if you are not a professional trader.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 105511488214, 'load_duration': 1468647, 'prompt_eval_count': 1224, 'prompt_eval_duration': 4388812000, 'eval_count': 689, 'eval_duration': 100972410000}
