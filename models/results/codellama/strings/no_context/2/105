Personalized advertising and content: This purpose allows companies to serve users with more relevant content based on their interests and behaviors.\n2. Advertising performance measurement: This purpose allows companies to measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns and make adjustments accordingly.\n3. Developing and improving services: This purpose allows companies to improve their products and services based on user interactions and preferences.\n4. Ensure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors: This purpose allows companies to monitor for and prevent unusual or potentially fraudulent activity, as well as correct any problems that users may encounter in the delivery of content and ads.\n5. Deliver and present advertising and content: This purpose allows companies to deliver targeted advertisements and content to users based on their interests and behaviors.\n6.
