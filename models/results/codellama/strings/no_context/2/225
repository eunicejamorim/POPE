It was founded in 2017 by Justin Katz, who also created the now-defunct site Tumblr. Fandom allows users to create communities around specific topics or characters, and provides a platform for fans to share their love for those content creators with one another. The site has since expanded its features, including the ability for fans to create their own fanfiction, as well as to create their own fan art and cosplay content.\n\nFandom has become increasingly popular over the years, particularly among young adults and teenagers who are known as "Young Fandom." The site\'s growth in popularity has also led to controversy from some parents and educators, who have raised concerns about its potential impact on children\'s attention spans and social skills. Despite these challenges, Fandom continues to be a vibrant platform for fans to connect with one another and share their enthusiasm for their favorite content.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 42671051728, 'load_duration': 1285076, 'prompt_eval_count': 1732, 'prompt_eval_duration': 6646969000, 'eval_count': 229, 'eval_duration': 35913538000}
