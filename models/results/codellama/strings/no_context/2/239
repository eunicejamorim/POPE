The movie takes place 10 years after the events of the first film, and follows Paul and his mother Princess Irulan as they travel to the planet Arrakis to reclaim it from the Harkonnens, who have taken control of the spice there. Along the way, they encounter new allies and enemies, including the Fremen, a nomadic group that has been living on Arrakis for generations, and the Bene Gesserit, a powerful and secretive religious order.
