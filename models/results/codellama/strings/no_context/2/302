It is one of the most widely read newspapers in the United States, with a circulation of over 2 million copies per day. The Times is known for its in-depth reporting and analysis of national and international news events, as well as its coverage of politics, business, culture, and entertainment.\n\nThe newspaper was founded by Joseph Pulitzer, a Hungarian-born Jewish immigrant who came to the United States as a teenager. Pulitzer started the paper in 1851 with the goal of providing a platform for political cartoons that were considered offensive or controversial at the time. Over the years, The New York Times has expanded its coverage to include a wide range of topics, including business, sports, and international news.\n\nOne of the most notable features of The New York Times is its page 1 position in major news events. The newspaper\'s editorial staff works around the clock to provide up-to-the-minute coverage of breaking news, often before other news outlets have reported on it. This has led to The New York Times being considered a trusted source for many people, particularly in politics and international relations.\n\nThe newspaper also has a strong commitment to diversity and inclusion. In 2018, The New York Times became the first major news organization to establish an official reporting fellowship program for underrepresented journalists. This initiative aims to promote diverse voices and perspectives in the media industry and to provide opportunities for young women and minority journalists to gain experience and build their careers.\n\nIn addition to its print edition, The New York Times also publishes a digital version of the newspaper on its website. The website features interactive features such as audio and video reports, as well as a range of tools that allow readers to create customized news feeds and share articles with others. The Times has also launched a number of other digital initiatives, including its podcast "The Daily" and its mobile app, which provide users with access to live updates and analysis on current events.\n\nOverall, The New York Times is an influential and respected source of news and information in the United States. Its commitment to accuracy, diversity, and innovation has made it a trusted voice in many people\'s lives, and its digital presence has allowed it to reach a wider audience than ever before.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 85684229833, 'load_duration': 1593759, 'prompt_eval_count': 1446, 'prompt_eval_duration': 5283520000, 'eval_count': 527, 'eval_duration': 80287155000}
