The company was founded in 1851 and has since grown to become one of the largest media companies in the world, with operations in over 30 countries.\n\nOne of the ways that NYTCo uses personal data is through its online advertising businesses. These businesses use cookies to track users\' browsing behavior across multiple websites and platforms, which allows them to deliver targeted ads based on a user\'s interests and preferences. The company has implemented various measures to ensure that users\' privacy is protected while still allowing for the collection of data necessary for these purposes.\n\nNYTCo uses AdGear, an ad tech platform owned by Google, to manage its online advertising businesses. AdGear stores cookies with a maximum duration of about 395 days and uses other methods such as "local storage" to store and access information on users\' devices. The company has implemented measures to protect users\' privacy while still allowing for the collection of data necessary for delivering targeted ads, such as using ad blockers to prevent third-party cookies from being stored on users\' devices.\n\nNYTCo also uses Google Analytics to track user behavior across its websites and platforms, which allows it to measure traffic patterns and identify areas of the site that may need improvement. However, NYTCo has implemented measures to protect users\' privacy while still allowing for the collection of data necessary for these purposes, such as removing personal data from the analytics reports and providing users with the ability to opt-out of tracking.\n\nIn addition to its online advertising businesses, NYTCo also collects personal data through its newsstand publications and other offline channels, such as its newspaper distribution business and its children\'s books division. The company has implemented measures to protect users\' privacy while still allowing for the collection of data necessary for these purposes, such as using secure payment processing methods and providing users with the ability to opt-out of data collection.\n\nOverall, NYTCo takes a number of steps to ensure that it is collecting and using personal data in a responsible and transparent manner. The company has implemented measures to protect users\' privacy while still allowing for the collection of data necessary for delivering targeted ads, as well as providing users with the ability to opt-out of data collection on a voluntary basis.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 93568025548, 'load_duration': 1283886, 'prompt_eval_count': 1829, 'prompt_eval_duration': 6965150000, 'eval_count': 526, 'eval_duration': 86454434000}
