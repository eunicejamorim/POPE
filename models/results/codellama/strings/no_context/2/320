However, in recent years, he has faced criticism for some of his lyrics, particularly those that have been seen as homophobic or transphobic. In response to this, Eminem has taken steps to distance himself from certain fans and audiences who may be offended by his words.\nOne such example is the "Slim Shady" persona that Eminem created in the early 2000s. This character was known for using offensive language and making light of controversial issues, but it also became a source of controversy and criticism. In recent years, Eminem has taken steps to distance himself from this persona, such as releasing new music that is more family-friendly and less provocative.\nHowever, some fans have accused Eminem of trying to "kill off" Slim Shady in order to secure his legacy. This may be seen as a way for him to distance himself from certain audiences who may not approve of his controversial lyrics or persona.\nIn terms of his music, Eminem has continued to release new albums that are more family-friendly and less provocative than some of his earlier work. He has also collaborated with other artists on projects that are more socially conscious and less focused on controversy.\nOverall, it seems that Eminem is trying to distance himself from certain audiences who may be offended by his words or persona, while still maintaining a level of creative control over his music and image. While some fans may not approve of this approach, it seems that Eminem has learned from the controversies of the past and is now trying to use his platform for good in more positive ways.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 63769207892, 'load_duration': 1324959, 'prompt_eval_count': 1368, 'prompt_eval_duration': 4824087000, 'eval_count': 395, 'eval_duration': 58797269000}
