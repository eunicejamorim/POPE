The reviewer mentions that the jacket fits perfectly, aside from the length being too long for their needs, and that the price was reasonable considering the quality of the product. They also mention that they have not had the opportunity to inspect the jacket closely yet, but it seems undamaged. The reviewer also mentions that the delivery guy took photographs of the box and marked the delivery as damaged, which may indicate that the issue is with the shipping company rather than Macy's. Overall, the review is positive and highlights the quality and fit of the jacket."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 29844186336, 'load_duration': 1505848, 'prompt_eval_count': 1783, 'prompt_eval_duration': 6721507000, 'eval_count': 146, 'eval_duration': 22974521000}
