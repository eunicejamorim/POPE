It is easy to clean, leak free, and it keeps water cold for a long time. The straw is also very convenient and flexible. Additionally, it fits well in car cupholders, making it perfect for road trips or camping trips. I have had no issues with the bottle so far, and I am very satisfied with it.\n\nThe Hydro Flask has a wide range of colors to choose from, and the agave-flavored water is refreshing and delicious. The brand is also very reliable and has a good reputation for producing high-quality products. Overall, I would highly recommend the Hydro Flask to anyone looking for a great water bottle.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 35315165658, 'load_duration': 1914733, 'prompt_eval_count': 1840, 'prompt_eval_duration': 6994795000, 'eval_count': 176, 'eval_duration': 28195981000}
