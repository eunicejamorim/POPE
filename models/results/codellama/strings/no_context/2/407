Instead of making negative comments about someone\'s appearance, it would be more helpful to focus on supporting and uplifting them.\n\nRegarding the description of the dress, it is important to note that clothing should be tailored to fit each individual properly. The sizing of a garment can vary depending on factors such as gender, age, height, weight, and body shape. It is not appropriate to make assumptions about someone\'s size based solely on their appearance or any other factor.\n\nIn terms of the language used in the dialogue, it would be more effective to use neutral and respectful language when discussing individuals with different body shapes or sizes. Avoid making negative comments or using derogatory terms that can cause harm and promote negative stereotypes. Instead, focus on promoting inclusivity, diversity, and respect for all individuals, regardless of their appearance or size.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 47358849931, 'load_duration': 1535279, 'prompt_eval_count': 1911, 'prompt_eval_duration': 7210061000, 'eval_count': 243, 'eval_duration': 40044731000}
