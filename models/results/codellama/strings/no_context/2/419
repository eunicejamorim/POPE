It is important to properly dispose of these plastic tubes and avoid using them as a receptacle for other items. Instead, remove the cap from the plastic tube and recycle it along with other plastic materials in your local recycling program. This will help minimize the amount of plastic waste that ends up in landfills and oceans, and reduce the environmental impact of single-use products like lip balm tubes.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 21005055303, 'load_duration': 1388577, 'prompt_eval_count': 1172, 'prompt_eval_duration': 4174149000, 'eval_count': 126, 'eval_duration': 16688163000}
