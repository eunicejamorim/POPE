To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that there are no typos or misspellings with your name, street address, city, state, and zip code. Additionally, you should verify that your billing address on your credit card bill is exactly the same as you have entered. If the address is outdated, you may want to try an old address, because in some cases, it takes a while for banks to update their information.\n\nIt's also important to note that with each submission, you will place another hold on your funds for the total amount of the order. In many cases, submission with a valid credit card number with an incorrect billing address will still result in a hold on your account. If this occurs, please note that those authorizations will drop off your account within 2-4 business days depending on your issuing bank.\n\nIf you are experiencing issues with your order, it is best to contact your bank directly for further assistance."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 41355684531, 'load_duration': 1311267, 'prompt_eval_count': 1599, 'prompt_eval_duration': 5929432000, 'eval_count': 232, 'eval_duration': 35283016000}
