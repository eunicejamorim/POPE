Some common reasons for excluding edits include:\n\nBots and tools: Edits made by automated systems such as bots and tools are often excluded from the site, as they can be seen as a threat to the integrity of the content on Wikipedia. These edits may not meet the same level of quality standards as human-made edits, and may contain errors or inaccuracies that could compromise the accuracy of the information on the site.\n\nViolations of site policies: Edits that violate Wikipedia's policies or guidelines are often excluded from the site. These include edits that add controversial or inflammatory content, edit other people's articles without their consent, or make changes to the site's structure or layout without permission.\n\nControversial or sensitive topics: Edits that address controversial or sensitive topics are often excluded from Wikipedia, as they may be considered off-topic or inappropriate for the site. These include edits that discuss political or religious beliefs, personal attacks or harassment, or other types of content that could be seen as threatening to the site's neutrality and inclusivity.\n\nGood faith: Wikipedia has a system in place to determine whether an edit was made with good faith or not. Edits made with bad faith are often excluded from the site, as they may be considered vandalism or other forms of harmful activity.\n\nQuality filters: Wikipedia uses a set of quality filters to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the information on the site. These filters use machine learning algorithms to identify edits that do not meet the site's standards for accuracy, clarity, and completeness, and may exclude these edits from the site.\n\nIn summary, excluded edits are those that do not meet Wikipedia's standards for quality, content, or good faith, and are therefore removed from the site. These can include edits made using bots or tools, those that violate site policies, controversial or sensitive topics, and those made with bad faith."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 88487831172, 'load_duration': 974542, 'prompt_eval_count': 2009, 'prompt_eval_duration': 7837804000, 'eval_count': 481, 'eval_duration': 80539166000}
