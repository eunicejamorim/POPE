This is because Quora allows users to create profiles and share personal information about themselves on the platform. Additionally, the page may include information about the user's interactions with other users, such as their answers, questions, comments, and upvotes/downvotes. This information can be used to tailor the content and recommendations presented to each individual user based on their preferences and interests.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Quora has implemented various measures to protect user privacy, such as anonymizing user data, limiting access to personal information, and implementing strict data protection policies. The platform also provides users with tools to manage their privacy settings and control who can see their content.
