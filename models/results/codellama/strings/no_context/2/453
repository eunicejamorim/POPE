The framework provides a structured approach for vendors to obtain informed consent from users regarding the use of their personal information and ensure that it is used in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\n\nThe IAB Transparency & Consent Framework includes the following purposes:\n\n1. Use limited data to select content: This purpose allows vendors to use limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type, or which content you are (or have been) interacting with, to deliver personalized and relevant ads to users.\n2. Use precise geolocation data: This purpose allows vendors to use precise geolocation data with your acceptance to determine your precise location (within a radius of less than 500 metres) for advertising purposes.\n3. Actively scan device characteristics for identification: This purpose allows vendors to actively scan device characteristics, such as the installed fonts or plugins, the resolution of your screen, and other device-specific data, to distinguish your device from others in support of the purposes explained in this notice.\n4. Ensure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors: This purpose allows vendors to use your data to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them.\n5. Deliver and present advertising and content: This purpose allows vendors to use certain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.\n6. Match and combine data from other data sources: This purpose allows vendors to match and combine information about users from multiple sources, such as their activity on a separate online service, their use of a loyalty card in-store, or their answers to a survey, in support of the purposes explained in this notice.\n7. Link different devices: This purpose allows vendors to consider your device as likely linked to other devices that belong to you or your household (for instance because you are logged in to the same service on both your phone and your computer, or because you may use the same Internet connection on both devices).\n8. Identify devices based on information transmitted automatically: This purpose allows vendors to distinguish your device based on information it automatically sends when accessing the Internet (for instance, the IP address of your Internet connection or the type of browser you are using) in support of the purposes exposed in this notice.\n9. Use data for advertising and content delivery: This purpose allows vendors to use your data to deliver targeted ads and personalized content based on your interests and preferences.\n10. Develop and improve services: This purpose allows vendors to use your data to improve their services, such as by providing more relevant ads or tailoring the content you see based on your behavior.\n\nThe IAB Transparency & Consent Framework provides a clear and transparent way for advertisers, publishers, and platforms to communicate with users about their data use and privacy practices. By using this framework, vendors can obtain informed consent from users regarding the use of their personal information and ensure that it is used in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 114166492297, 'load_duration': 1138134, 'prompt_eval_count': 1036, 'prompt_eval_duration': 3666960000, 'eval_count': 785, 'eval_duration': 110351085000}
