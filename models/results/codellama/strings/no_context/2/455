The framework sets out how companies can obtain, use, and disclose user data while providing users with more visibility into what data is being collected, how it is being used, and why.\n\nHere are some of the key features of the IAB Transparency & Consent Framework:\n\n1.

This includes providing users with detailed information about how their data will be used and ensuring that users have a clear understanding of what personal data is being collected and why it is needed.\n2. Data Subject Rights: The framework establishes specific rights for users who want to exercise control over their personal data, such as the right to request access to their data, to obtain a copy of their data, or to object to processing of their data.\n3. Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA): The framework requires companies to conduct a DPIA before collecting and processing sensitive personal data about individuals. This involves assessing the potential impact of data collection on individuals' rights and freedoms, as well as identifying potential risks associated with the data collection process.\n4. Transparency: The framework encourages companies to provide users with clear and transparent information about how their data is being collected, used, and shared. This includes providing users with detailed information about what data is being collected, how it is being used, and why it is needed.\n5. User Controls: The framework provides users with more control over their online data privacy by allowing them to manage their personal data and access information about how their data is being used. This includes providing users with detailed information about what data is being collected, how it is being used, and why it is needed.\n6.
