However, if you are concerned about your data security, you may want to consider using a secure method for sharing links, such as a password-protected link or a tool like HTTPS Everywhere. Additionally, you can use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to encrypt all data transmitted between the user's device and your website, which can help protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nHere are some additional security measures you can take:\n\n1. Use HTTPS Everywhere: This extension forces all websites visited using Google Chrome to use HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). This encrypts data transmitted between the user's device and your website, which can help protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.\n2. Use a VPN: A VPN (Virtual Private Network) can be used to encrypt all data transmitted between the user's device and your website. This can help protect against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.\n3. Use secure protocols for sharing links: If you need to share a link with a specific user, consider using a password-protected link or a tool like HTTPS Everywhere. This will help ensure that the data transmitted between your website and the user's device is encrypted.\n4. Implement secure coding practices: Make sure that any code you use on your website is properly secured, including any third-party libraries or plugins used.\n5. Keep your website up to date with security patches: Regularly update your website with the latest security patches and updates to ensure that any vulnerabilities are addressed before they can be exploited by attackers."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 55191225526, 'load_duration': 1022473, 'prompt_eval_count': 1071, 'prompt_eval_duration': 3748307000, 'eval_count': 386, 'eval_duration': 51305192000}
