It provides a seamless and intuitive understanding of the mathematical formulations underlying sound processing, from simple discrete expressions of sound waves to the subjective impression of sound.\n\nThe book covers a wide range of topics in audio engineering, including basic concepts such as frequency and time-domain analysis, and new perspectives on solving acoustical problems through phase properties. It also includes practical examples and real-world applications of sound processing techniques.\n\nThis book is useful for researchers, students, and practitioners in the field of audio engineering, signal processing, and music production who want to gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental principles of sound processing and analysis.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 27834294140, 'load_duration': 1210354, 'prompt_eval_duration': 144173000, 'eval_count': 202, 'eval_duration': 27550124000}
