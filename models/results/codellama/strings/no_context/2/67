The `class` attribute is used to apply a custom class to the button so that it can be easily styled using CSS.\n\nHere are some tips for adding products to an Amazon cart using the dpUrl syntax:\n\n1. Use the correct ASIN: Make sure you use the correct ASIN for the product you want to add to the cart. You can find the ASIN in the URL of the product\'s detail page on Amazon. For example, if the product\'s detail page URL is `https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07CX6LN8F`, then the ASIN is `B07CX6LN8F`.\n2. Use the correct quantity: Make sure you specify the correct quantity of the product that you want to add to the cart. If you don\'t specify a quantity, Amazon will assume a default value of 1.\n3. Use the correct URL: Make sure you use the correct URL for the button. The `href` attribute should point to the Amazon cart add URL, which is `https://www.amazon.com/gp/cart/add.html`.\n4. Customize the button: You can customize the appearance of the button by using CSS to style it with your own styles. For example, you could use the `class` attribute to apply a custom class and then define that class in your stylesheet.\n5. Use JavaScript events: You can also use JavaScript events such as `onclick` or `onmouseover` to trigger actions when the button is clicked or hovered over. This allows you to perform additional actions, such as displaying a confirmation message or sending data to an external service, before adding the product to the cart.\n6. Use Amazon\'s API: You can also use Amazon\'s API to add products to the cart programmatically. This can be useful if you want to add products to the cart in response to user actions or if you need to add a large number of products to the cart at once. For more information, see Amazon\'s documentation on their API.\n7. Use a library: If you are using JavaScript, you can also use a library such as `amazon-cart` to simplify the process of adding products to the cart. This library provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with Amazon\'s API and allows you to add products to the cart from your code.\n8. Use a WordPress plugin: If you are using WordPress, you can also use a plugin such as `Amazon Cart` or `WooCommerce Amazon Payments` to integrate Amazon\'s payment gateway into your website and allow users to easily add products to their carts.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 112149016734, 'load_duration': 1541728, 'prompt_eval_count': 1392, 'prompt_eval_duration': 4848371000, 'eval_count': 699, 'eval_duration': 107197903000}
