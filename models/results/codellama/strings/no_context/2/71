It offers several benefits to its users, such as attractive Cashback offers, a low annual fee, and a user-friendly app for monitoring transactions. However, despite its many advantages, it is still awaiting a new version that may offer even better conditions and features.\n\nThe Lbb Kreditkarte has been a popular choice among customers, but unfortunately, the development process has been slow. Many users are eagerly waiting for a new version of the card with improved conditions and additional features. It would be great if Amazon could surprise its customers with a new innovative card that offers even more benefits and convenience.\n\nOverall, the Lbb Kreditkarte is a solid choice for those who value cashback rewards and low fees, but it may not be suitable for everyone due to the slow development process of the card. As a result, customers should carefully consider their options before making a decision.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 33760598360, 'load_duration': 1729540, 'prompt_eval_count': 1103, 'prompt_eval_duration': 3966840000, 'eval_count': 227, 'eval_duration': 29673056000}
