TradingView does not store your payment credentials, and they are encrypted and passed through an API to Braintree (owned by PayPal) for processing. This ensures that your payments remain safe and secure while also providing an easy and convenient way to make purchases on their website.\n\nYou can pay for a TradingView subscription using all major credit cards, PayPal accounts, Apple Pay, or crypto payments such as BTC, ETH, USDC, USDT, BCH, LTC, DOGE, DAI, Matic. Additionally, you can use any payment method supported by the App Store or Google Play on their mobile apps.\n\nIf you are paying with crypto, you will need to switch to the "Crypto" tab on the Order page and follow the instructions provided by Coinbase, TradingView\'s payment processor for crypto transactions. You can only pay with crypto for annual plans only.\n\nYou can cancel your subscription at any time, and it will not auto-renew after the current paid term. Paid service will remain active until the end of the paid term, and a canceled trial will stop immediately after cancellation.\n\nTradingView has a Refund Policy that allows for refunds only for annual plans and after an automatic deduction within 14 calendar days after the payment was made. There are no refunds for initial orders or monthly plans.\n\nYou can also upgrade your TradingView subscription at any time with no extra transactions needed. All remaining days of your current plan will be automatically converted into equivalent value days on the new tier, and you don\'t lose anything, just use the remaining amount to switch to a better version.\n\nIf you downgrade, your current plan will stay exactly as it is until its subscription date, then once it expires, your new downgraded plan will go live at the selected rate.\n\nExtra real-time data can be added separately to your account for an additional fee. All extra real-time and intraday data for exchanges - NASDAQ, NYSE, NYSE ARCA, OTC, CME, etc. - are available to be added separately to your account.\n\nThe difference between professional and non-professional subscriptions is that "Professional" usage relates to common business activity where market data is used on behalf of businesses or entities, funds or asset managers, while "Non-Professional" usage refers to market data for personal use only.\n\nYou can still buy a professional plan if you are not a professional trader and will have access to all the features that it provides, including more alerts, data, multiple charts, and more.\n\nThe Enterprise plan is TradingView\'s very best features in one package, with plenty of advanced research tools and market data for businesses and entities. You can also opt into professional data if you are a non-professional user.\n\nTradingView has an Educational Partner Program that allows you to bring advanced research tools and market data to your classroom and study. It is designed for educational institutions, universities, schools, and other educational establishments.\n\nYou can also use the TradingView desktop app, mobile app, CME Group futures, Eurex futures, US stocks bundle, or company information on the website. The Wall of Love is a feature that allows users to send messages to each other, while the Social Network allows you to connect with others and share your thoughts and ideas.\n\nThe Widgets section provides additional charts and market data for free, while the Charting Libraries provide more advanced charting tools and libraries. The Lightweight Charts™ library provides a lightweight alternative to the Advanced Charts library for mobile devices.\n\nTradingView also has partnerships with brokerages and financial institutions, such as CME Group futures, Eurex futures, US stocks bundle, or company information.
