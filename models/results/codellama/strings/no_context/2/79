{'model': 'codellama', 'created_at': '2024-06-10T08:34:03.005387933Z', 'message': {'role': 'assistant', 'content': '  The descending widening wedge is a chart pattern that can be traded through breakout of the pattern or pullback to the broken zone. This pattern is formed when there is a decline in price followed by a larger decline in price, creating a "V" shape with the two shorter legs forming the top and bottom of the "V". The broken zone is formed when the price breaks through the bottom of the wedge, creating a gap below the wedge.\n\nWhen trading this pattern, it\'s important to consider the size of the legs and whether they are strong or weak. If the legs are strong, the chance of a breakout is higher, but if the legs are weak, the price may not have enough strength to break out of the pattern. Additionally, the shape of the top and bottom legs can affect the outcome of the trade. A longer leg at the top and a shorter leg at the bottom can make it more difficult for the price to breakout of the pattern, while a shorter leg at the top and a longer leg at the bottom can increase the chances of a breakout.\n\nIn general, the descending widening wedge is considered a bullish pattern because it indicates that there is strong downward momentum in the market. However, if the legs are weak or the price breaks through the broken zone, the trade may not be successful. Therefore, it\'s important to consider all factors before making a decision based on this pattern.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 57178522659, 'load_duration': 1212139, 'prompt_eval_count': 1795, 'prompt_eval_duration': 6942783000, 'eval_count': 309, 'eval_duration': 50091277000}
