Provide a clear opt-out option for users who do not want their data to be collected.\n2. Obtain informed consent: Users must give their consent before any personal information is collected or shared. This means that you should obtain explicit consent from users before collecting any personal data, and ensure that the consent is easily accessible and can be withdrawn at any time.\n3.

Provide clear and easy-to-understand information about how you collect, use, and share personal data.\n4.
