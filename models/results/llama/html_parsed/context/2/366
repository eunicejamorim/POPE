The HTML file includes a `<div>` element with an ID `ot-selall-hostcntr` that has an input field (`<input id="select-all-hosts-groups-handler" type="checkbox">`) and a label associated with it. This suggests that the page is collecting consent information from users.\n2. There are multiple instances of `<div class="ot-chkbox">` elements throughout the HTML file, each containing an input field (`<input ... type="checkbox">`) and a label. These appear to be related to user consent and preferences.\n3. The presence of `ot-selall-hostcntr`, `ot-selall-vencntr`, and `ot-selall-licntr` IDs suggests that the page is collecting information about users\' consent choices for different categories or groups (e.g., "hosts", "vendors", and "leg").\n4. The `<button id="clear-filters-handler">Clear</button>` element implies that users have the option to clear their filter preferences, which suggests that they are being stored.\n5. The presence of `ot-text-resize` and `sf-widget-cookie` iframes suggests that there may be additional user-specific information being collected or stored.\n\nOverall, based on these findings, I would say that this page contains user-specific information.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 50058104795, 'load_duration': 4041539, 'prompt_eval_count': 1440, 'prompt_eval_duration': 5533109000, 'eval_count': 287, 'eval_duration': 44253501000}
