There are also a few instances of Portuguese and Romanian.\n2. **Hashtags**: Hashtags are used frequently, with many being related to entertainment (e.g., #movie, #funny), sports (e.g., #futbol), and lifestyle (e.g., #skincare).\n3. **Usernames**: Usernames like @GabrielðŸ‡§ðŸ‡§, @Anitta, and rayomisterioso are mentioned, suggesting that these accounts might be popular or well-known.\n4. **Content themes**: The text includes a mix of topics, such as:\n\t* Entertainment (movies, TV shows, music)\n\t* Sports (futbol, cars)\n\t* Lifestyle (beauty, fitness, relationships)\n\t* Humor (funny videos, pranks)\n5. **Account types**: There are mentions of TikTok LIVE and Creator Networks, suggesting that these accounts might be focused on live streaming or content creation.\n6. **Private information**: The text includes some private information, such as email addresses (authorization.thesis@gmail.com) and usernames (janedoe462).
