The server has various roles that members can self-assign, such as "Chill Gang" or "Study Gang".\n2. There are also roles that cannot be self-assigned, like "Early Member" for the first 100,000 members to join the server.\n3. The server has a leveling system based on message count, with roles automatically given as you level up.\n4. Members can participate in voice chats and send messages in certain channels, depending on their role and level.\n5. The server has a team of moderators (Mods) who help keep the community safe and friendly.\n6. There is an application form for becoming a moderator, which requires being 18+ and having a welcoming, kind, and mature personality.\n7. Boosting the server provides exclusive benefits, such as a profile badge that evolves over time and a place at the top of the member list.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any specific questions or would like me to help with anything!'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 38999999451, 'load_duration': 835140, 'prompt_eval_count': 81, 'prompt_eval_duration': 753773000, 'eval_count': 237, 'eval_duration': 38108517000}
