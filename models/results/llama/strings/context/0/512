Here\'s my report:\n\n**Grammar:**\n\n* The text is well-written, but there are a few minor issues:\n\t+ In the sentence "Reverso detects and corrects all types of grammar and spelling mistakes:", consider changing "types" to "forms" or "kinds" for more precise language.\n\t+ Some sentences could be rephrased for better clarity and flow. For example, the sentence "Students Add style and clarity to your essays, while avoiding unintentional plagiarism." is a bit awkward; consider breaking it up into two separate sentences.\n\n**Spelling:**\n\n* The text appears to be free of major spelling errors.\n* However, there are a few instances where words are used incorrectly or ambiguously. For example:\n\t+ "Add style and clarity to your essays, while avoiding unintentional plagiarism" is unclear - consider rephrasing for more precise language.\n\n**Punctuation:**\n\n* The text generally uses proper punctuation, but there may be some minor issues with commas (e.g., in the sentence "Reverso detects and corrects all types of grammar and spelling mistakes:" where a comma is unnecessary).\n\n**Style:**\n\n* The text is clear and concise, but could benefit from some rephrasing to improve flow and readability.\n* Some sentences are quite long and might be better broken up for easier comprehension.\n\nOverall, the text is well-written, and the minor errors can be easily addressed through editing.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 50816463360, 'load_duration': 813260, 'prompt_eval_count': 1290, 'prompt_eval_duration': 4723793000, 'eval_count': 310, 'eval_duration': 45956980000}
