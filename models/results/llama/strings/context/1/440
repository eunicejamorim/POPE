Bola vulnerability refers to a type of authorization flaw in an application\'s API endpoints, which allows attackers to access sensitive data or perform unauthorized actions.\n2. The name "BOLA" stands for "Broken Object Level Authorization", and it is also known as Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR).\n3. Bola vulnerabilities can be exploited using simple scripting techniques, making them a significant risk to application security.\n4. Identifying a Bola vulnerability typically involves observing how an application constructs its URLs or API endpoints, looking for direct references to internal implementation objects.\n5. The concept of Bola is relatively straightforward, but it has far-reaching implications on the security of an application or platform.\n\nOverall, this text provides a comprehensive overview of the Bola vulnerability and its significance in the context of application security.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 39012087383, 'load_duration': 1039323, 'prompt_eval_count': 1524, 'prompt_eval_duration': 5534582000, 'eval_count': 213, 'eval_duration': 33342665000}
