The text is in English, with some quotes and phrases translated from Italian and Dutch into English.\n\nThe text highlights the advantages of using DeepL Translator over Google Translate, citing its ability to provide more accurate and nuanced translations, particularly for languages such as Italian and Dutch. It also mentions that DeepL has surpassed other translation services, including those offered by Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and Google.\n\nSome of the key points mentioned in the text include:\n\n* DeepL Translator can recognize language quickly and automatically, converting words into the target language while trying to add linguistic nuances and expressions.\n* The tool is particularly good at grasping the meaning of sentences rather than being derailed by literal translations.\n* DeepL has outperformed other translation services, including Google Translate, in tests for languages such as Dutch-to-English and Italian-to-English.\n* The tool can produce translations that read more fluently and make sense, unlike Google Translate's word chains.\n* DeepL is a good example of how a smaller company (in this case, a German company) can surpass larger players in the field.\n\nOverall, the text presents a positive review of the DeepL Translator tool, highlighting its strengths and advantages over other translation services."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 47134936600, 'load_duration': 946361, 'prompt_eval_count': 1423, 'prompt_eval_duration': 5344535000, 'eval_count': 275, 'eval_duration': 41648528000}
