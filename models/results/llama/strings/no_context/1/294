These should not be present in a regular text string.\n2. **Unbalanced tags**: Some HTML tags are not closed or are missing. For example, ` \ue80f` and `\ue72e` seem to be incomplete tags.\n3. **Special characters**: The text includes special characters like ` \ue80f`, `\ue946`, `\ue8c7`, etc., which may cause issues when processed as regular text.\n4. **JavaScript dependencies**: The text mentions JavaScript, which is a programming language that requires specific processing and execution.\n\nTo proceed with the analysis, I recommend:\n\n1. Removing HTML code and special characters to obtain a clean text string.\n2. Verifying the integrity of the text by checking for any broken or unbalanced tags.\n3. Examining the content of the text without considering its original context as an HTML file.\n\nIf you'd like to proceed with the analysis, please provide me with the cleaned-up text string."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 28386030338, 'load_duration': 776805, 'prompt_eval_count': 423, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1363194000, 'eval_count': 228, 'eval_duration': 26884958000}
