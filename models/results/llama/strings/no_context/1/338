The main navigation menu with links to different settings and analytics.\n2. A custom background image or video upload feature.\n3. Options for choosing a button style, font, and color scheme.\n4. Integration with social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, YouTube).\n5. An NFT (non-fungible token) profile image selection feature.\n6. Language translation options using Bing Translate.\n\nThe code is quite extensive, so I won't provide a detailed analysis here.
