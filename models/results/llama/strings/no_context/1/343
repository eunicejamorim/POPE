However, I can suggest some possible ways to do so:\n\n1. Look for a "Bag" or "Shopping Cart" section on the webpage and see if it has an option to remove or delete items.\n2. Check for any buttons or links that say "Remove", "Delete", or "Cancel" near the item you want to delete.\n\nIf you need further assistance, please let me know which specific part of the text you would like me to focus on!'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 24902054208, 'load_duration': 859703, 'prompt_eval_count': 1397, 'prompt_eval_duration': 4969020000, 'eval_count': 133, 'eval_duration': 19795182000}
