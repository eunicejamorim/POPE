Here\'s what I found:\n\n**Repeating patterns:**\n\n* There are many strings in the format "X of Y" (e.g., "3062 of 3134"), which might be some kind of product information or inventory data.\n* There are also many mentions of "Macy\'s" and other related terms, like "Customer Service", "Credit Card", "Gift Cards", etc.\n\n**Other notable strings:**\n\n* "Be the first to know with our emails" (marketing or newsletter signup?)\n* "Tell Us What You Think" (feedback form?)\n* "Macys.com, LLC" (company information?)\n* "GCP catalog - browse Page Layout - Canvas" ( possibly some kind of technical data?)\n\n**Cookie-related strings:**\n\n* There are many mentions of cookies and cookie-related terms, such as "Strictly Necessary Cookies", "Functional Cookies", "Performance Cookies", and so on. This suggests that the website uses cookies for tracking and personalization.\n\n**Other miscellaneous strings:**\n\n* There are some strings mentioning languages (e.g., English, Arabic, Hebrew) and country names (e.g., United States).\n* Some strings appear to be related to legal or compliance issues, such as "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" and "CA Transparency in Supply Chains".\n\nLet me know if you have any specific questions about these strings or if there\'s anything else I can help with!'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 56332692693, 'load_duration': 1222325, 'prompt_eval_count': 1630, 'prompt_eval_duration': 6326895000, 'eval_count': 310, 'eval_duration': 49865117000}
