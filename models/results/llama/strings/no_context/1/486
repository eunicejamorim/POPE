While the idea of reviewing businesses and discovering new places sounds great, the execution fell short.\n\nThe most notable issue I had was with the "Review" section. The prompt to find a business to review was nice, but the fact that they\'re out of suggestions is frustrating. It\'s like being shown an empty plate at a restaurant - it\'s not very encouraging.\n\nI also found the layout and design of the website to be confusing. The numerous links and tabs made it difficult to focus on what I wanted to do. And don\'t even get me started on the font sizes and styles - my eyes are still recovering from the strain!\n\nOn the plus side, I did appreciate the effort to provide multiple languages and a translate feature. It\'s a nice touch for users who may not speak English as their first language.\n\nOverall, while Yelp has potential, it needs some serious improvements to become a go-to platform for reviewing businesses. Until then, I\'ll be taking my business (pun intended) elsewhere.\n\n**UPDATE:** After re-reading my review, I realize that I may have come across a bit harsh. In reality, the website is still in development and has its growing pains. I hope Yelp takes my feedback into consideration and improves the user experience.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 33544040355, 'load_duration': 823300, 'prompt_eval_count': 241, 'prompt_eval_duration': 833169000, 'eval_count': 288, 'eval_duration': 32570146000}
