The text is written in a formal tone, which may not be suitable for all audiences. For example, the language used in the "Grammar Check" section might be too technical for some readers.\n2. There are a few instances of repetitive phrasing, such as the repeated use of "your success" and "unintentional plagiarism." Varying sentence structure and word choice can help to improve clarity and engagement.\n3. Some sentences could be rephrased for better flow and readability. For example, the sentence "Reverso detects and corrects all types of grammar and spelling mistakes: wrong verb tenses, lack of agreement between subject and verb, incorrect prepositions, confusion between words with similar spelling, typos and punctuation errors" is a bit long and could be broken up for better comprehension.\n4. There are no major issues with sentence structure or syntax.\n\nOverall, the text appears to be well-written and free of significant errors.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 36360438390, 'load_duration': 715819, 'prompt_eval_count': 1213, 'prompt_eval_duration': 4306768000, 'eval_count': 221, 'eval_duration': 31917569000}
