The CSS code defines various styles for different elements on the webpage, such as fonts, colors, and layout.\n\nThe HTML code includes some basic structure elements like `<div>` and `<a>`, as well as some JavaScript code that appears to be used for animations and interactions on the webpage.\n\nThere are also some strings extracted from the HTML file of a webpage, including job titles, locations, and company information. These appear to be related to eBay's job listings or employee profiles.\n\nSome notable features of this CSS code include:\n\n* The use of media queries to define styles based on different screen sizes\n* The use of absolute and relative positioning to control the layout of elements\n* The use of transitions and animations to create interactive effects\n* The use of z-indexing to control the stacking order of overlapping elements\n\nOverall, this code appears to be used to style and layout a webpage for eBay's job listings or employee profiles."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 40833373762, 'load_duration': 797800, 'prompt_eval_count': 1634, 'prompt_eval_duration': 6323352000, 'eval_count': 216, 'eval_duration': 34365594000}
