Some roles provide access to specific channels or features.\n2. **Leveling system**: The server has a leveling system based on message count, with roles automatically given as users level up. The XP required to reach the next level increases significantly as you level up.\n3. **Moderators**: The @Moderator team is responsible for maintaining a safe and friendly community environment. They can be reached through private tickets in the ‚õîÔ∏èÔΩúreport channel.\n4. **Boosting**: Boosting provides exclusive benefits, including a profile badge that evolves over time and a place at the top of the member list. There are two ways to boost: using free boosts with a Discord Nitro subscription or buying them separately.\n5. **Community guidelines**: The server has community guidelines for users to follow, which can be found in the FAQ channel (‚ùìÔΩúfaq).\n\nLet me know if you have any specific questions about this text or need help with anything else!"}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 50297196909, 'load_duration': 928372, 'prompt_eval_count': 1589, 'prompt_eval_duration': 6008472000, 'eval_count': 280, 'eval_duration': 44151630000}
