The page has several navigation menus and links to various sections, such as "Movies", "TV Shows", "Watchlist", "Release Calendar", etc.\n2. There are references to IMDb\'s features, like "Top 250 Movies" and "Most Popular TV Shows".\n3. The page mentions user-specific information, like a watchlist and ratings, which suggests that users can create their own lists of favorite movies and TV shows.\n4. The text includes language options and support for various languages, including English (United States), French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, etc.\n5. There are links to IMDb\'s social media profiles, as well as a mention of the company\'s Amazon affiliation.\n\nOverall, this seems like a standard IMDb webpage with a lot of useful features and information for movie and TV show enthusiasts!'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 28666406893, 'load_duration': 763170, 'prompt_eval_count': 567, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1953888000, 'eval_count': 217, 'eval_duration': 26581569000}
