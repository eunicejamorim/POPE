The text is in English, but there are also links to translate it into various other languages.\n\nThe list includes countries from around the world, including some dependencies and territories. It seems to be a comprehensive list of all countries recognized by the United Nations (UN).\n\nSome interesting facts about this list:\n\n1. It contains 249 country names.\n2. The list includes several dependencies and territories, such as "Portugal Change" (likely referring to Portuguese-speaking countries), "Christmas Island", and "Cocos (Keeling) Islands".\n3. Some countries are listed under their former or unofficial names, such as "British Indian Ocean Territory" instead of just "India" or "DRC" instead of "Democratic Republic of the Congo".\n4. The list includes some countries that no longer exist, such as "Yugoslavia" (which has since been dissolved into several independent countries).\n\nOverall, this appears to be a useful reference for anyone working with international data or developing an application that requires country-specific information.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 31178484075, 'load_duration': 927342, 'prompt_eval_count': 702, 'prompt_eval_duration': 2331848000, 'eval_count': 228, 'eval_duration': 28710567000}
