The language used is formal and technical, which can be challenging for non-experts to understand.\n2. The text includes legal terminology and phrases that may not be familiar to many readers, such as "amicable negotiations," "arbitration," and "governing law."\n3. The text is dense and lacks clear headings or subheadings, making it difficult to follow the structure and flow of the information.\n4. There are no visual aids, such as diagrams or flowcharts, to help illustrate complex concepts.\n\nHowever, if you\'re familiar with legal documents or have experience in international trade, you may find this text more readable than someone without these backgrounds.'}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 32102810185, 'load_duration': 2254221, 'prompt_eval_count': 1758, 'prompt_eval_duration': 6822596000, 'eval_count': 155, 'eval_duration': 25136863000}
