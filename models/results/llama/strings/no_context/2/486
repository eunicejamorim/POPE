On the one hand, I appreciate the vast array of businesses listed on the platform, which makes it easy to find and review local spots. The user interface is also straightforward and user-friendly.\n\nOn the other hand, I was disappointed by the lack of suggestions for new reviews. As someone who enjoys discovering hidden gems in my community, this limitation made me feel a bit stuck. However, I appreciate Yelp's promise to provide more suggestions soon, which gives me hope for future interactions with the platform.\n\nIn terms of overall functionality, Yelp seems to have its strengths and weaknesses. While it can be useful for finding information about local businesses, some features, such as the ability to translate content into different languages, feel a bit clunky.\n\nOverall, I would recommend Yelp to anyone looking to discover new places or share their own reviews with others. With a few tweaks to improve user experience, I believe this platform has the potential to be even more helpful and enjoyable for users."}, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'done': True, 'total_duration': 24445739247, 'load_duration': 733389, 'prompt_eval_count': 240, 'prompt_eval_duration': 846090000, 'eval_count': 216, 'eval_duration': 23463774000}
